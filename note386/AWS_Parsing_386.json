The patient told KATU\u0027s I-Team that it took her a year and a half, and numerous phone calls, emails and in-person visits to get her asthma medication.  In a press release issued by the Health Department, Dr. Jeffrey Tylianos, the hospital\u0027s Chief Medical Officer, said the department had reviewed the case and issued a ruling on Feb. 9 based on the findings of the clinical case report.  \"We made a decision based on the information we had, given the findings of the clinical case,\" said Tylianos. \"We did not hear back from a single patient that felt the drug was too expensive or was not working.\"",
