  "note": "   Patient Was not advised of an immediate medical procedure, such as a cat scan, etc  Patient Was told of a \"life threatening emergency\" and was transferred without the use of an ambulance  Patients who were transported by ambulance, however, should have been given immediate information on how to care for the patient (e.g., how to obtain appropriate resuscitation, appropriate care during transport)  Patients who were transported by ambulance were not given information on appropriate transportation methods, such as being provided with an escort or being allowed to drive for two hours  The EMS professional who transported the patient did not make any efforts to contact any other medical facilities during the trip (e.g., no calls were made to nearby hospitals to check up on the patient)  The EMS professional who transported the patient did not explain to the hospital staff that the patient was a Jehovah\u0027s Witness to protect religious privacy (e.g., \"we\u0027re not sure where he came from, but we had to transport him\"); this is even more concerning when the Jehovah\u0027s Witness may have been a minor and therefore not able to take part in religious services, thus leaving the EMS professional vulnerable to the risk of exposing the patient to religious privacy concerns  There would have been a huge potential for abuse to occur if the ambulance was transported by ambulance and not by ambulance and ambulance alone, where the patient would be in very close proximity to the paramedics  Some of the other more serious errors involved the following:  If the ambulance was not equipped with an EMT-B or trained in CPR, then it was even more critical (and potentially deadly) that the ambulance crew have emergency medical skills so as to be able to render emergency medical assistance  The EMS professional who transported the patient should have been given specific and thorough information on when and how to begin CPR, how to properly and effectively administer CPR and even the appropriate procedures for CPR (e.g., how long to stop CPR, when and how to continue CPR, breathing techniques, CPR position requirements, etc)  The EMS professional who transported the patient should have been given information on the use of an endotracheal tube or other types of breathing assistance apparatus  The EMS professional who transported the patient should have been given guidance regarding what types of procedures she should do in order to minimize trauma to the patient, such as how to avoid head injuries if she was to deliver a laceration  The dispatcher could have easily sent ambulance personnel to other hospitals and/",
