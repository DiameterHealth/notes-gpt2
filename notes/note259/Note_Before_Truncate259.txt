PROMPT:

Medical Decision Making: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

RESPONSE:

  and his physician will continue to perform an ongoing evaluation of his medical condition. During this time, the PCP may recommend a PCP visit. If the physician has continued a follow-up with the patient after that day, a new PCP visit may be recommended.   If a patient's PCP determines that he or she has an acute neurologic illness and that further evaluation in another office would be impractical or inappropriate, the patient should be transferred to one of our hospitals for evaluation without delay.   The patient should be taken to a hospital room with a door covered with a plastic sheet and then to an operating room for an assessment, the administration of medications as needed , and, if appropriate, an inpatient stay.
