**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

and his physician will continue to perform an ongoing evaluation of his medical condition. During this time, the PCP may recommend a PCP visit. If the physician has continued a follow-up with the patient after that day, a new PCP visit may be recommended. If a patient's PCP determines that he or she has an acute neurologic illness and that further evaluation in another office would be impractical or inappropriate, the patient should be transferred to one of our hospitals for evaluation without delay.
