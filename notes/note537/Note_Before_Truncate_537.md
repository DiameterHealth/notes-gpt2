**RESPONSE:**

 . The woman is well-nourished and physically fit. Her physician does a complete physical exam including measurement of height, weight, chest, and a skin examination of the legs by an experienced dermatologist.  She is scheduled to receive a single dose, oral polio vaccine (OPV) administered in a multi-dose vial and followed by IM and intramuscular (IM) injections.  Background: It requires a high level of immunization to ensure protection against polio, one of the most dangerous communicable diseases of the world.  Dosage: A single dose of OPV will provide immunity for the life of the individual. However, a child who is too young to receive the OPV and is already receiving a single OPV dose as well as two doses of hepatitis B vaccine, may benefit from a booster dose of OPV at 12 to 15 months of age.  Oral polio vaccines are not a common method of immunization for pregnant women and children.  A booster dose of OPV is recommended for children between the ages of 2 and 12 when they had a previous dose of OPV and are not receiving OPV or any other hepatitis B vaccine at the same time the OPV is being scheduled.  Doses of OPV are increased after an infant is born. A single dose of OPV is recommended to the infant, followed by intramuscular (IM) and then a booster in infancy.  Recommended vaccine schedule: IM : 4, 6, and 12 months IM: 6 months after 6 month interval 3 doses of OPV 4 doses of OPV IM : 6 months after 6 month interval 3 doses of OPV  Procedure: After a well-child visit, the woman's health care team will discuss appropriate and contraindicated vaccines. The immunization schedule will have been completed for the patient; oral OPV is recommended as the primary immunization option.  The health care staff is also to discuss the risks and benefits of any potential complications of OPV. The patient's family is invited to a post dose checkup with family physicians to review their progress. At 6 months, an OPV booster is recommended and a skin test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is recommended.  DOSE FOR PREGNANCY:  1 dose of OPV given IM or IM and then intramuscular (IM)  DIAGNOSIS:  This case of possible delayed onset polio
