PROMPT:

Assessment: Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.

RESPONSE:

   Treatment:  If you are diagnosed with fever after a prolonged period, and/or with only urinary symptoms, then a hospital admission may be required. This procedure will not improve the prognosis and will usually result in hospital discharge in 3-5 days. If you feel you have been exposed to a pathogen, the first place to seek support is with your GP, who will have a better information to share with the medical team.
