**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.

**RESPONSE:**

  She was seen in the emergency room at 4PM and discharged with a full physical examination. Her labor lasted 12 hours with frequent contractions. Her midwife was scheduled to return to the hospital at 1AM on the morning of Jan 6th to assist with the next delivery. The delivery occurred with no fetal distress. An epidural was given. The patient had no adverse reactions. Two weeks after delivery, the pregnancy was continuing at 30+1 weeks of gestation.  Discussion: This case study illustrates the use of an early elective cesarean delivery in the absence of other obstetric complications. This can be considered a high-risk of complications, however, the patient recovered fully and was discharged from the hospital with no additional complication.
