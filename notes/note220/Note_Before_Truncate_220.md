**PROMPT:**

Assessment: Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and 

**RESPONSE:**

 erythromycin. He will be moved to a residential care unit once he has been monitored for 3 more days. He has not returned to active treatment work as the results of the blood test are still pending.  The following are some examples of what some people may have experienced as a result of an "overdose".  Blood test results were not available until many days after the poisoning.  Pt was not aware that someone else was not taking medication.  Patients were not aware that any symptoms other than pain were present.  At the time of the poisoning, other patients had a full response to treatment, although a full response to medications may not have been possible.  Patients had limited awareness of their own experiences because they did not realize that they had had similar reactions.  These examples show that symptoms which one may consider "drug related" may also have been caused by a reaction to an unknown cause that occurs in people from time to time.
