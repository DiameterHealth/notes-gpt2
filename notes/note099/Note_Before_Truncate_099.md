**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making (MDM): After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

**RESPONSE:**

  Patient was observed for an average time of four days.  Patient was seen on two separate occasions at each site of interest—a mass, on the second visit, was not palpable despite a small increase in mass and no change in the number of tumors. Eternal Virginity Condom and Pelvic Exam This was a review of several condom products to evaluate their ability to protect sexual pleasure (no sexual activity or sensation) and prevent STD transmission.   The study also concluded that condoms should " be considered as a risk-reduction strategy ," because no studies have shown protection against HPV infection, STDs , pregnancy, or other infections. This article, published by the American Journal of Urology , reviewed the literature relating to "female condom" sales and was critical of the marketing campaign designed to persuade women that wearing a condom "saves lives."   This study concluded it to be a "gross overstatement to claim an increase in the incidence of cervical cancer in the USA has been or is likely to be attributable to use of female condoms ." This was a review of several penile pumps to evaluate device functionality and patient characteristics to determine if an individual's penis is "overstretched."  This study found that the device (Luxenrol XL) is easy to use, easy to clean, and offers a "good fit and comfortable user experience."  However, there was an emphasis in this study to increase the user experience in order to encourage long-term use, which I think is a good idea because it requires careful design, construction, safety tests, training, and evaluation before such a product can be placed on the market in the USA. There were two articles regarding pelvic examinations . One examined the anatomy of the female pelvis, especially sexual anatomy, and a discussion about how the pelvic examination should provide an objective and objective assessment . In addition, the article discussed the reasons for conducting pelvic exams, which generally were not found to be the most important reasons from patients. This study, published in the journal Female Sexual Function and Function, reviewed research related to the role of the urogenital region , including vaginal, vulvar, and clitoral examinations.  For this review and patient evaluation, two investigators identified 10 studies of vaginal examinations and 16 studies of other sexual examinations.  The authors of two of the studies reviewed conducted vaginal examinations and a third conducted pelvic examinations.  The findings from these three studies indicated no differences between the vaginal and other sexual examinations examined.   This
