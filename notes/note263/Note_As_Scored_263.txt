RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

Fever: The most common symptom of malaria is fever, which is often accompanied by vomiting. The fever can be brought on by being bitten by a mosquito, but fever is not a symptom of malaria as yet, it has to go through a series of stages before it becomes malaria fever. Once the symptoms have progressed to fever, malaria will start to break out.
