**PROMPT:**

HPI Comments This is a follow-up visit for diabetes management and for management of glucose control. The pt was previously referred to a nephrologist

**RESPONSE:**

  who found the pt to have elevated liver enzymes. The nephrologist determined the pt was in need of endoscopic treatment for hepatic necrosis, and the endoscopic procedure was performed. The postoperative nephrologist followed up with a 1 to 3-year follow-up appointment to review serum and urine values. After the nephrologist reviewed these outcomes, he determined the pt was stable and would be suitable for endoscopic treatment of hepatic necrosis. Hepatic necrosis was successfully treated by endoscopic excision of both hepatic and biliary tracts, using a 3-mm biopsy suture. This procedure also repaired a fractured proximal intercostal space. At the subsequent follow-up visit, the pts reported decreased frequency of urination and urine output, as well as a gradual worsening of his edema, hepatomegaly, and weight loss. The pt had limited sleep. Serum beta values were normal at follow-up. No treatment was needed for the pt, as well as for the patient who underwent endoscopic hepatic necrosis, the pt did not need surgical therapy again. Patient's Response The patient reported the following: 2 months post-operative:  "I still have the same tiredness that I had a few days following operation. The morning would be fine and the day after I feel more tired than I did the day before."  2 months post-operation:  "I would describe my daytime as normal and my evening/night time as being a little better."  21 months post-operative:  "The patient told me that he was not in the best of spirits due to the post-operative symptoms and thought he might be more irritable. He was relieved that the surgeon saw no need for additional therapy."
