  allergist.  Preliminary:  The patient had been given a complete physical exam with skin prp. No significant findings were noted but she had had a recent cold. She also was given a complete physical exam with skin prp. An allergic reaction to a patch test showed a positive patch test with mite testing and positive blood tests. Her skin prp and blood tests had shown she does not have skin allergies. Skin prps from her physician show a positive skin prp.  Treatment 1.  Treatment 1.  Initial:  The patient was taking ocrelizumab (Nizoral) 1/4 tablet daily. A patient initiated therapy of the ocrelizumab (Nizoral) for a history of rhinitis since 3 years of age and had a previous reaction. The patient's previous reactions were rhinitis with nasal congestion, nasal irritation and sensitivity to the patch test. On the patient's request, the allergist added a corticosteroid eye drop once a day and an atypical steroid eye drop once a day.  Intervention:  ocrelizumab (Nizoral) was started and continued continuously at a dose of 0.25mg/day, starting at a dose of 30 mg twice daily.  Treatment 2:  The patient refused to continue the ocrelizumab (Nizoral) at this point, and started an oral corticosteroid at 40-50 mcg, twice daily. A patient with mild-moderate allergic rhinitis was seen to begin a treatment with ocrelizumab (Nizoral) for a history of asthma since 4 years of age and had an allergy at the start of this new medication. When a positive patch test was found, the patient was prescribed the following medication regimen and was treated immediately until her allergy resolution. She continued a daily eye drop from her previous doctor for asthma. Allergies are not well documented when evaluating atypical steroid treatments for acne in children.  Treatment 3:  Allergy testing showed her atypical glucocorticoid receptor and corticosteroid receptors have been identified. She is taking ocrelizumab (Nizoral) at a rate of 0.25mg/day with a patch test at 50 mcg twice daily. T-SCREEN Testing  Treatment 4: The patient continues ocrelizumab to treat
