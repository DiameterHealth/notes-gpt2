_______________ I have had this for the past year and had never had any other symptoms before my last symptom but now every morning I feel extremely bloated and have very loose stools . I had an IV for my stools but they came out really bad and I have been dealing with these symptoms for the last 2 weeks so I decided to get checked up.
