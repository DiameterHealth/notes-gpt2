PROMPT:

Past Medical History Patient reports gassy and bloated feeling and has had irregular stools over the past two week 

RESPONSE:

 _______________ I have had this for the past year and had never had any other symptoms before my last symptom but now every morning I feel extremely bloated and have very loose stools . I had an IV for my stools but they came out really bad and I have been dealing with these symptoms for the last 2 weeks so I decided to get checked up. There were no changes or symptoms on my physical exam or labs that I was given, my GI doctor just saw me last night for an upper GI surgery. My stomach was slightly distended and I had some pain at the end of my lower esophagus. He asked me about the last two weeks and my usual diet, did I eat anything on the day before or night before? My answer was "no" the whole night. I felt better after the doctors answer and he didn't do anything but get me to the hospital and let me see the doctors. My doctor has been on call and has asked me several times if I want to see a GI doctor, but I have been avoiding it since I have gotten ill because I really don't want to think about all the food I eat. I have to deal with this symptom everyday because I don't know what to do. It has been 1 1/2 months since my symptoms began and I feel like its gotten worse since I was diagnosed with this. I have been going to a local naturopath for the past few months. She has asked me to stay away from red meat because she thinks it is unhealthy. If you guys have any advice, I think it would be good to try a homeopath, chiropractor, massage therapist or herbalist. Any suggestions??
