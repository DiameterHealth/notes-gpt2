  at hospital. She underwent a lumbar puncture on Jan 4th but continued to require support from her spouse to keep her from straining.  Cervical Scans: Pulsed Doppler (PM): Pulsed Doppler used in this case indicated cervical dilation. The cervical dilation was in the direction of the cervix and the lower portion of the cervix. No fetal remains were observed by ultrasound.  Cervical Occipital Excavation: The first section of the cervical canal was removed in the early hours of Jan 8th. This was an exploratory cervical dissection in progress that identified the presence of a large amniotic fluid collection on the surface of the vaginal walls. Her head and neck temperature was at 97.4°F. Her skin was firm and her vaginal walls were thickened. The cervix was palpable and there was no fetal motion when palpation was done.

The cervix and cervix dilatation were present, although the cervix was not dilated. The second cervical section of the canal was removed on Jan 8th. On this particular cervical exam, the physician felt that there was a need to do additional follow
