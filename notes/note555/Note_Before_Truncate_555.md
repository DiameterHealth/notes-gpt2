**PROMPT:**

HPI The patient presents with eye pain and worsening vision. He reports bluriness over the past feel days without history of glaucoma, cataracts or other eye disease

**RESPONSE:**

 ; he has had a single eye cataract removed three years ago. The following laboratory findings are present: pH of 7.41; platelet count, 6.7 K/mm3; hematocrit, 62%; glucose, 100 mg/dL; creatinine, 40 mg/dL. A complete medical, neurological and ophthalmologic examination is inconclusive with a history of severe headaches, sleep disturbance and poor appetite with nausea.  Treatment: Initial therapy consists of acetaminophen, aspirin and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to limit intraocular pressure. The patient may be placed for laser therapy for the visual acuity loss. The patient experiences an improvement of 5/10 vision at the age 22. There is a continued improvement of the patient's vision. At age 51 his vision becomes 10/15 at 10 years and he can now read a newspaper, drive, read newspapers at home and he reads many books with ease.  DISCUSSION:  There is an increased prevalence of this disease with the onset of the first century (6). Its clinical presentation has changed over the intervening years but the symptoms remain essentially the same, with some variations in severity. The prevalence of this complication increases with time and the average lifetime risk is 7/1000. There is not a significant association with prior cataract surgical procedures or the age of the patient at presentation. In addition there is an age gradient in its association, which is similar in younger and older patients (8). Patients who had been diagnosed with glaucoma, but not affected by it, are likely to have this complication. However, the majority of patients have a family history of the disease. The prevalence of subacute and chronic glaucoma is not known and it is difficult to extrapolate from epidemiologic studies.  Previous Section Next Section DISCUSSION OF THE ACHILDHOOD OCCUPANCY:  The prevalence of childhood glaucoma is 4/1000 to 10/1000 (10):  Age in Years per 1 and 3 year prevalence of glaucoma (10,14)  Age in Years per 1 and 5 year prevalence of glaucoma (19)  Age in Years per 1 and 10 year prevalence of glaucoma (12,15,17,21)  We did not find any study reporting a better prognosis of the infant with this disease (20). It is important to discuss the potential
