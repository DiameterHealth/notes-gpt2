RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

A surgical treatment should be undertaken. The patient was found to have an aortic dissection due to a tear in the aortic arch. The procedure to repair the aortic arch was performed through the pericardium, and a small, open incision was made in the aorta. The aortic dissection was repaired by reattaching the aortic arch with the use of arthroscopic suture.
