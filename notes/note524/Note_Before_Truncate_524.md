                              THE MEDICINAL USE OF THE SODA INDUCED CHOLESTEROL SIDE EFFECTS BASIC  - The body can utilize some of the substances released from the kidneys. The kidneys do not normally release substances to the blood (and vice versa), but as the body is forced to take in a significant amount of fluid due to dehydration, the body produces a substance that it can use in place of the normal urine. This product is known as choline. Choline is a substance that is readily produced in the liver (the largest organ in the body), and which is produced by the kidney during a process called gluconeogenesis. Because gluconeogenesis reduces body fat, and because the breakdown of choline is the largest metabolized product of gluconeogenesis, the production of choline (the body's preferred source of choline) has the desired effect: it allows the body to survive during periods of dehydration.

Cholinesterase is one of the substances that is normally produced by the liver, and it is a liver activity.  Cholinesterase has the following pharmacological function:  (1) The rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion to acetylcholine.
