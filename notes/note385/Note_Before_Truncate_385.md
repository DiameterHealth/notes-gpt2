**PROMPT:**

HPI The patient is a 78 year old female with a history of stroke and hypertension. She recently fell in her home and reports dizziness and lightheadness

**RESPONSE:**

 . Blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg and pulse is 85 beats per minute with a pulse pressure of 100 mm Hg. The patient's right arm is also weak. The physical exam is normal. The ECG is also normal. The patient has a 10 cm hematoma in the lower left lobe of her brain. It is draining fluid, but there are no obvious abnormalities. The patient has a positive family history of atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent transcatheter bradycardia monitoring with a beta-blocker and vasopressor on the evening of admission. The patient was observed frequently before admission and discharged after 2 days without further complications. On day 1 there was complete recovery, with no further recurrences after 2 days of symptomatic treatment. All other parameters and tests were normal. On further follow-up the patient had significant worsening of her symptoms. She underwent coronary angiography and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy for her left ventricular dysfunction. She also has an implanted defibrillator. Her symptoms have decreased gradually. Since the patient did not require hospitalization, this study was performed to investigate the recurrence rate, and to assess if any prognosis is affected by the transcatheter bradycardia monitoring (TBR) protocol. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted from 2 consecutive patient visits at the University Hospital, Copenhagen. The patients were identified retrospectively as being susceptible to recurrence and, if so, were studied. The TBR protocol was used for both visits. RESULTS: A total of 14 and 34 patients (17 and 22 respectively in the two visits respectively) were documented. The average time between the admission with a TBR and the first recurrence (2.4 +/- 2.9 months) was 2.5 +/- 1.8. Recurrence occurred in 12.2% of the exposed cases compared with 9.8% in the control group. Among the patients with recurrence, the highest recurrence rates (63% and 58%) were observed in the group with high initial TBR (<60 cm/s and <100 mm Hg). Among the non-recurrence cases, the lowest recurrence rate (17% of exposed cases) was observed. The recurrence rate was similar between groups in the two visits. The recurrence rate also was similar between visits with a TBR (18% and 25%) and in the group with high TBR (17% and 31%). Patients with a non-rec
