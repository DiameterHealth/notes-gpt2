PROMPT:

Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.

RESPONSE:

   Innovative management:  The patient was managed within her institutional setting in the most efficient way possible. The fetus was delivered at term in a breech presentation.  Conclusion:  Our experience suggests the use of a cedric clamp, similar to that used in many other settings outside the United States, should be considered.  References: (2, 4, 5)  1. Tuck, S. F.
