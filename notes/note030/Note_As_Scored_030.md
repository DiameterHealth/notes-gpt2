**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

Innovative management:  The patient was managed within her institutional setting in the most efficient way possible. The fetus was delivered at term in a breech presentation. Conclusion:  Our experience suggests the use of a cedric clamp, similar to that used in many other settings outside the United States, should be considered. References: (2, 4, 5)  1. Tuck, S. F.
