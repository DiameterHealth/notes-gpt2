His medical team will be providing updates as I get them.  Thanks,  J.P.  Thanks to everyone over the last few days:  Thanks for the support (both direct donations and kind words of encouragement):  The entire team here at DMSHQ is delighted with all your donations and their generosity. As one team member shared with me, this is my first game, so I want to put my best foot forward on behalf of Team Phoenix. We are trying our best to honor both the donors and recipients. This is an important story and a difficult journey for both the donor and DMS staff. So much so, we are in need of you to help us continue to tell it!  And, a special thank you to those of you on Facebook who donated your time over the last few weeks for our ongoing coverage! The support from that community has been a tremendous help for the team, especially in the last few days. If you missed any of the last updates, don't worry because we've recently come back online, and we've got a lot of great updates for you.  Sincerely,  Derek & Shannon
