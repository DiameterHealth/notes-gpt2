**PROMPT:**

HPI Comments The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

**RESPONSE:**

  Pelvic and head x-rays are unremarkable.  Fever on examination (38.6C) and ECGs are unremarkable. In a recent prospective multicentre observational study, there were a mean age of 67 for the patients and 66 for the controls (mean age 61.2).   The median follow up was 15 years for the patients and 15 years for the controls. A total of 19 patients (6%) had had symptomatic recurrence of their condition. Of these, 7 had GERD recurrence (3 each for GERD, hypophysectomia and pulmonary oedema), 1 had a pulmonary oedema recurrence (2nd episode of hypophysectomia and OSA) and 1 had a relapse of GERD (3rd episode of hypophysectomia and OSA). Only 2 of them developed acute lung injury as a result. The risk of the recurrence of GERD was not greater in patients who did not have other risk factors for the development of GERD, except for age.  The incidence of OSA was similar between hypophysectomized patients and controls, while severe obstructive sleep apnoea was more frequent in the former group. The risk of developing acute exacerbation with worsening of both symptoms and oxygen saturation was greater in the hypophosphatonic patients, but none were classified as having the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The authors conclude " These findings suggest that the incidence of hypophosphatonic respiratory failure and the risk of its exacerbation with worsening of both symptoms and oxygen saturation are similar in hypophosphatonic patients and controls, however, the incidence of acute exacerbation is greater in the hypophosphatonic groups. It was also demonstrated that the incidence of the exacerbation of GERD and the risk of its worsening with worsening of both symptoms and oxygen saturation were increased in the hypophosphatonic group."  So what is the evidence for GERD exacerbation with sleep apnoea in the hypophosphatonic population? Let's start with the data I have from studies of patients with GERD and OSA and the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Table 1 shows the results from a meta analysis in which they compared the incidence of GERD, obstructive sleep apnoea and the exacerbation of GERD, as measured by the use of a gas monitor (i.e. FEV1 <25%) among hypophosphat
