**PROMPT:**

HPI Patient is being seen today for her obstetrical visit. She is at 27w0d weeks gestation. Patient reports no complaints, no bleeding, no leaking, no contractions.

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

She is a very beautiful, healthy looking, and healthy little girl. This is probably the most perfect ultrasound picture we have ever seen. We would love to help you find a couple who can adopt her. Her parents and grandparents would give her the first 3 years of her life to know and love her. Her parents, grandparents and foster parents would be very loving and willing to go the extra mile to be a great home.
