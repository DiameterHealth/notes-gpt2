**RESPONSE:**

  that might occur with ulcer healing. Pt's ulcer was treated with antibiotics on a 5day schedule. She was asked to return to work on Monday, September 9th and has not felt any pain. She has continued to have swelling and will continue with follow up work.  Laboratory Values: HR of 65, BP of 130/80, HR of 130/80 and a normal PEEP of 5mm Hg.  Laboratory Changes: No changes in lab values.  Management of Patient  On Sep 4th, Pt returned to work and felt better on September 7th. On September 7th at 0830hrs Pt's wife contacted the hospital on Pt's behalf. Upon arrival they learned that Pt could not go home. He remains in the ICU for continued management and observation.  The patient did not need any interventions.  Post Intubation  Patient was intubated on the 2nd day of ICU stay. An attempt to pass the oral endoscopy tube was futile at this time. The patient had a very slow respiratory rate. It wasn't clear how the patient was able to wake up on his own to try to pass the tube. It seemed his blood pressure and pulse were low. It seemed his diaphragm was not functioning well. A large amount of fluid was drawn during the procedure. This was done during a general anesthetic, not as a result of any underlying pathology. It was unclear if the fluid was used for some reason other than the IV line for feeding and hydration. The tube was removed later on the 2nd day of ICU stay.  Seat belts were removed.  Tubal occlusion was attempted before the endoscopy tube was passed. This was unsuccessful because the patient did not have sufficient lumen for the IV line. The tubes were not changed.  Transcutaneous needle biopsy was performed on the patient. The area of interest was on his thigh muscle because of the high pressure of his heart. This biopsy was performed on September 12th in the ICU. There was no change in the CT scan. Blood was drawn on September 17th. An attempt was made to change the IV line, which was unsuccessful.  The CT scan was clear on September 15th. The patient had no apparent neurologic deficits. On September 16th the patient went to the emergency department after his wife complained of severe abdominal pain.
