**PROMPT:**

Assessment: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE:**

  The patient is also found to have right pectineus muscle weakness, medial tibial nerve compression with anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with right side weakness and the presence of biceps tendonitis in the biceps femoris (p-1 and p-2). The patient presents with an ankle pain, lateral swelling and fever.  Management: The patient is given prophylactic anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type I, II and IV and an anti-inflammatory and anti-diarrheal treatment.  Radiologic evaluation shows right posterior compartment syndrome (right side flexion at the tibial and fibular levels) at level C6 with degenerative changes (papillomas) associated with calcified synovitis at C6. Right hip abduction dysfunction is noted with right side weakness at C6. The patella is dislocated at D4 along with right pectineus muscle and the biceps tendonitis is noted in the biceps femoris. An echocardiogram and chest X-ray with echocardiogram are negative for myocarditis and left heart failure but shows the patient's right knee to be arthritic.  A repeat evaluation 10 months later demonstrates a right anterior compartment syndrome with an enlargematous patella dislocation and calcified synovitis at C6, with left lower lateral compartment at D1 and right patella muscle weakness. The patient is now treated with anti-inflammatory and anti-diarrheal treatment.
