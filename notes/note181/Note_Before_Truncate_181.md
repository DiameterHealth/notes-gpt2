Management of Chronic Intracranial Haemorrhage  Intracranial haemorrhage is the most frequent and most serious complication of stroke. Intracranial haemorrhaging can occur when blood is drawn in an out-of-hospital setting to prevent or reduce bleeding. In a hospital or inpatient setting, clotting factors in the blood may protect against further blood loss. The presence of an intrapleural hematoma may also be considered when assessing hemodynamic instability and the presence of bleeding.  Clinical presentation: Intracranial haemorrhage can occur in either acute or subacute stroke (Fig. 2).  Figure 2. The cerebral circulation after a major ischaemic stroke. The anterior left lateral ischaemic hemisphere (AAL) is contuberentially compressed by the posterior corpus callosum. The corpus callosum may appear as if it has bulged above and below the head of the interhemispheric fissure (PICT) due to the massive infarction associated with the haemorrhage. There may also be a right posterior infarction of the corpus callosum due to an anterior hemodynamic shift occurring around the stroke site. Figure shows a right corpus callosum. Note the posterior corpus callosum and corpus callosum. Figure demonstrates the location of the anterior hemiscopic ischaemic stroke, which involves both hemispheres. The ischaemic stroke caused by the intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) is considered atypical because it involves both hemispheres and is usually the most severe outcome resulting in cerebral death (CPH). However, in cases of mild to moderate ICH, CPH and the subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) are common clinical presentation. In both severe and moderately severe ICH, a large arterial haemorrhage (see Figure 3:) with a left temporal contour is found with cerebral atrophy (see Figure 3:; PICT, SAH), cerebral edema, and myelopathy.  Clinical course: As shown in the above figure, there is a progressive hemorrhage from an ischaemic site and associated deterioration of brain tissue. The intracranial
