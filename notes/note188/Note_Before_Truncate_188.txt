  She was given birth training the week before and the nurses who performed the Cesarean was experienced. She gave birth to an intact baby girl, born in an Emergency Cesarean and delivered safely and with a low risk of mother, newborn, and child complications. The obstetric staff member on shift that night took the mother outside her room to perform some simple vaginal labor, which was helpful. She was admitted in the middle of a normal labor and delivery to see her. The mother had some signs of depression that started in her labor and was resolved within a few hours without medications.
