**PROMPT:**

AP:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE:**

  Tissue examination shows degenerative change in the synovium [ ] and iliac walls [ ] of the femur with hyperostosis [ ] and thickening at the periosteal border, but no calcification. Tendon ultrasound examination of the right tibial tubercle (2 weeks postinjury) shows no patellar fracture and no joint involvement, but a synovial fluid-impacted tear is seen along the lateral wall of the tibia.  (10) Inclusion criteria:  A. An individual with unilateral femoroacetabular impingement in the right tibia without evidence of fracture or dislocation and who has been in sport for 3 or more years.  B. The patient's sport (or activity) includes a high rate of repeated impact trauma/impact sports.  C. There is no evidence of an injury in the right tibia at baseline as defined by the patient's history or physical examination.  D. The athlete has no other injury(s) that appear to be atypical for the patient.  E. There is no evidence of a history of instability, dislocations, dislocation, or other abnormal instability in the right leg.  F. The patient does not have evidence of any of the following prior to or during treatment: sports, repetitive trauma, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or cerebrovascular disorders.  G. The patient is not a paraplegic.  PATIENT:  The patient was a track and field athlete prior to the injury and was in good physical health prior to the injury. The patient is unable to walk on the right leg or complete any level of sport in that leg because of leg pain/inflammation, and is unable to complete any amount of exercise for a maximum of 1 year post injury.  CASE REPORT:  A 29-year old woman underwent an MRI to evaluate the severity of a traumatic contusion of the tibial tubercle involving the proximal aspect of the femur. The patient was admitted at an initial screening visit with a history of moderate pain and fatigue in the right lower leg. She was initially given a right lower extremity brace with a 1-2cm extensor mechanism. Although the patient was still able to perform activities including heavy-lift resistance training and sit-ups, she was not able to complete any sport or activities on her right leg. The patient was in moderate pain until
