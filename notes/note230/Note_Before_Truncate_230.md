**PROMPT:**

Assessment: The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care

**RESPONSE:**

 .  Radiology: No imaging indicated any tumor findings. Radiographs showed no signs of focal soft tissue calcifications. At this time, the radiologist stated that they have no additional clinical or imaging findings of interest, and no treatment options were considered.  Endocrine: This patient was treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Her initial T 4 was 7.14 pmol/L and her TI at 8.3 pmol/L. Her serum thyroid hormone levels were elevated for patients with normal levels, and the levels were stable for many years. After two weeks, however, the level began to change. The thyroid hormone levels declined gradually at a rate of 50 units per month until 11.2 months after treatment. The thyroid hormone levels then rapidly increased at a rate of 500 units per month. No other clinical, laboratory, or imaging abnormalities are available. Thyroid function testing was completed at 13.3 months with a high TSH level. The thyroid hormone levels subsequently declined after her return to work.  Nutritional: Her nutrition was managed by the primary care physician. She had received a multivitamin and supplement. Her food intake was not severely restricted. She was advised to continue to monitor her vitamin and vitamin E levels and to take her thyroid hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and other medications as prescribed.  Discussion: Her symptoms improved by approximately one year post treatment. There was no evidence of recurrence. After the thyroid was suppressed, she was told she needed to monitor her vitamin levels and that she may need to take her thyroid hormone medication on a monthly basis. She has been taking it for 5 years since she stopped anti-thyroid medication. After several years of treatment, her serum TSH level was stable between 600 and 650, and her fasting serum T3 level was 4,450. It has been reported that patients with mild to moderate thyroid disease who take thyroxine for a long time have a normal TSH, T4, T3, and free T4 and a normal free T3 level.  CONCLUSION: Thyroid suppression with levothyroxine alone may be an option for treating mild to moderate hypothyroidism without hypogonadism. The risk of thyroid injury from taking a subtherapeutic dose of levothyroxine is minimal, and in most cases it is considered to be acceptable. It may become intolerable at high doses.
