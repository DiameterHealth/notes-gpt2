 . He is in excellent health and has no history of cardiac symptoms or risk factors. His family history of stroke is also negative. He is able to walk without assistance. He has been attending a chiropractic clinic for 30 y.o. and has had no significant changes in his daily activity. The patient has had a recent visit to a different chiropractor who suggested a physical exam (with palpation on the abdomen). The initial examination revealed a mild left shoulder tenderness which progressed to right shoulder tenderness, and eventually, pain in the left mid-back region. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the sacral, sacroiliac, and left lower trapezius muscles. The physical exam also revealed pectus excavatum and tenderness in the right upper quadrant and back of the right upper arm. The patient is a non-smoker, and has a weight of 70 kg. He reports feeling a sharp pain on palpation in the right sacral area in response to movement. He is not a patient with any cardiac symptoms or risk factors. He does not have previous spinal surgery. The patient's family history of stroke is positive, as is history of hypertension, diabetes, or prior trauma or other acute illness. The examination was recorded as "limited." What happened during the examination? What did the physical exam reveal? Were there any findings that led the physician to suspect that the patient's symptoms might be related to a medical problem?
