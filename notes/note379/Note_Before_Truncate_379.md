**PROMPT:**

HPI This is a follow-up visit from prior encounter for back pain. The patient is continuing physicial therapy and OTC medications to manage the pain

**RESPONSE:**

 . There is improvement. The pain is in the upper back and involves the L4 and L5 vertebral columns. The pain is constant and severe. The patient is able to maintain full motion of arm and legs without pain. The L2–L5 vertebral intervertebral discs are inflamed and cracked. The patient is being operated on based on findings. L2–L4 discs may be inflamed and cracked causing back pain. Aortic valve prolapse may be present or present with aortic dilatation but can be controlled with medications. The patient is receiving continuous medication to control pain with the exception of hydrocortisone painkiller to decrease the pressure in the back. The patient's mobility is limited without pain reliever and has a significant limitation on their ability to walk. Patient is a young male with a history of back pain.  P6 – L6/L7:  P6 – PRN4: (L6/L7) The pain is the result of L6–L7 vertebral intervertebral disc tears. The patient has been taking meds to treat her pain which is in the L6– L7 vertebral disks. The patient is being taken off the meds. The patient has been in pain for some time and is still trying to manage the pain with the meds. The L6– L7 vertebral intervertebral discs are torn and not fully healed. L6–L7 discs are the most flexible of the discs. The L6– L7 disc tears are very minor. The L7– L8 disks (L4– l6) are not involved and have had no previous problems. L6– L7 injuries can appear on any disc and can be quite difficult to detect. The vertebral nerves which are involved in the lumbar spinal fusion are responsible for the spinal manipulation (which is the only difference between disc tears in those two vertebrae) which cause back pain. The patient is being managed through a physiotherapist. Aortic valve prolapse may be present with aortic dilatation but can be controlled with medications. The patient is receiving continuous medications to control pain with the exception of hydrocortisone to decrease the pressure in the back. L6– L7 disc injuries are usually detected in the L4– l6 range. The patient has an MRI which demonstrates disc tear in L6– L7 disc. The patient is being operated on based
