PROMPT:

HISTORY & PHYSICAL The patient presents with eye pain and worsening vision. He reports bluriness over the past feel days without history of glaucoma, cataracts or other eye disease

RESPONSE:

 , loss of night vision due to decreased eyesight, or other symptoms in the past few years.  TREATMENT OPTIONS The patient should be treated for a visual impairment first. If the initial eye symptoms are not alleviated with vision restoration/corrective lenses, then glaucoma surgery may be considered. A variety of glaucoma regimens have been used, involving surgery for obstruction or resection of the eye, intraocular steroids, or intratympanic steroid injections. These regimens have been shown to have significant short-term adverse effects, including decreased survival as well as increased frequency of retinal detachment, which could affect vision. Glaucoma surgery should not be attempted unless the patient's symptoms are sufficiently resolved before surgery.  OTHER IMPLICATIONS OF LASER RETINAL PERIMETER EXPOSURE There are other possible complications following cataract surgery including: infection around the laser procedure, scarring, and even the need for follow-up eye surgery.
