**PROMPT:**

Plan of Treatment:  The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care

**RESPONSE:**

  physician. A complete evaluation was performed. There was no history of chronic illness, medical history, or family history consistent with an allergy to eggs. There was only mild, mild asthma. The physician ordered an allergen screen to see if any previous or current allergies to eggs were present. There was no allergy. The physician concluded there was no contraindication. The patient's physician requested a repeat oropharyngeal examination of the patient after one year for additional allergy evaluation. The physician had a complete evaluation, and the patient reported having no more allergies. The physician confirmed a history of a history of food allergies as well as previous allergy to eggs. The allergist and primary care physician performed a complete oropharyngeal examination using the DRE protocol and discovered severe nasal obstruction. The patient is now on the most aggressive OTC/ER allergy regimen and continues the same allergy protocol as above. Oropharyngeal obstruction is an immediate cause of serious allergic reactions. Treatment of this condition is not just for the patient or family. This is an opportunity for your health care team to provide education and awareness to the entire health care team.  Summary:  There are some common food allergic symptoms such as nasal discharge, sneezing, and mild symptoms that can be mistaken for other conditions. These symptoms should not be dismissed and can easily result in an unnecessary trip to the ER for a serious reaction.  We believe these common food allergic symptoms should be identified and treated at the primary care level, with the right treatment that is tailored to each patient's special needs/wishes. Our oropharyngeal exam is a critical part of these initial evaluation and can help to provide early information about food allergy.  References:  Wendy A, et al.
