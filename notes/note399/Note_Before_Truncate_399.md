  in her hip. A referral was sought and a visit from an orthopaedic physician who specializes in hip disorders was arranged.  Surgeries and Medical Intervention  A biopsy of the degenerating tumor was performed, and the surgical treatment consisted of removing the tumor.

Conclusion  Overall, we found that there is a significant increase in the rate of hip pain in patients that present to the OTC pain clinic. The cause of this increase is yet to be identified, but the clinical evidence suggests there may be multiple causes (e.g., degenerating tumors, osteoarthritis). We suggest that further studies into the causes of hip pain should investigate this.
