**PROMPT:**

AP:  Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications

**RESPONSE:**

   PATIENT:  In accordance with treatment guidelines that have been in place since 1992, patient continues on medications currently in use with limited benefit  BACKGROUND: Current treatment guidelines for patients with AIDS-TDR were reviewed for use in this case. It has been concluded that they are of no benefit and that ongoing therapy is unnecessary or may actually worsen the disease [16] . However, there appears to be a lack of consensus regarding these guidelines for patients who had achieved CD4 cell counts of 350 cells/mm3, which is the accepted standard for CD4 cell count [16] .  DISCUSSION: The patient was advised of the need for ongoing HIV therapy, but is continuing with therapeutic regimens based on older, less effective, strategies which have an inadequate benefit and a higher failure rate. It appears to me that the patient is at high risk for TDR. It is recommended that the patient be referred to a specialist for evaluation and appropriate treatment.  AIM:  To determine the risk for TDR in a newly diagnosed homosexual man who has achieved a large CD4 cell count.  METHODS:  At presentation, HIV RNA levels were approximately 150-400 copies/ml in blood. T cell counts were below 350 cells/mm 3 and HIV RNA levels approximately 40 copies/ml in peripheral blood.  RESULTS:   The patient continued in treatment for approximately 7 years, even after achieving CD4 cell counts that were high compared with previously treated men infected with HIV. HIV RNA levels increased to levels sufficient for serological testing. After a series of 3 ART drugs the patient had achieved viral suppression. After cessation of ART the patient continued in therapy and after testing positive for HIV for 2 years has achieved viral suppression. In conjunction with clinical recovery, the patient has been able to start ART and to become undetectable using highly sensitive viral suppression testing. Further testing has shown that the patient remained HIV negative for a full year after reaching undetectable viral suppression and is still undetectable. The patient is now in long-term maintenance treatment with a potent combination of ZDV and suppressive HIV drugs.  CONCLUSIONS:  In this case, the patient experienced a successful outcome despite achieving HIV RNA levels in excess of 1000 copies/ml and T cell counts which were higher than have previously been reported in HIV-positive patients with TDR. It seems that this patient has developed a resistance to HIV ART and may also have acquired HIV through a partner of unknown serological status
