**PROMPT:**

AP:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.

**RESPONSE:**

  Her water broke early in the morning. She was then given a dilation of the cervix by a midwife. There was a delay in giving her oxytocin.  ED: What kind of response did she have when she had an epidural?  MCS: The patient did not have a reaction.  MCS: There is some concern that there may be an adverse reaction to the anesthesia given in the epidural. There was a delay in the administration of the dilation drug while the patient was being monitored at the hospital.  ED: And when was the dilation given at the hospital?  MCS: At 12:00 PM on the 3rd day.  ED: Thank you so much for being available to talk about this. It certainly is important to know.  MCS: Thank you for having me. This really is not going to compromise my decision in any way.  ED: Great. We appreciate the information.
