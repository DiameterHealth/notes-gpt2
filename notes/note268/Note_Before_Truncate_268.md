**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.	Medical Decision Making: 56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction

**RESPONSE:**

  with multiple cardiac troponin readings >8. Her initial symptoms of nausea and vomiting, and fever on admission were mild. Despite no specific laboratory findings, she underwent a complete EKG and pulmonary function study. Her primary diagnosis was AML with right ventricular ejection fraction (rVT/FF) of 0.6 and elevated cardiac troponin I (cth/Cti). Her EKG showed acute ventricular tachyarrhythmia, ventricular atrioventricular conduction abnormality, and myocardial ischemia on echocardiogram. A subsequent right atrial hypertrophy study of the aorta showed an initial right atrial diameter of 4 mm and an increase to a total right atrial diameter of 8 mm post-myocardial infarction. A lumbar puncture was given in addition to a pulmonary function study. A second rVT/FF on the ECG was normal. Post-procedure rVT/FFs ranged between 3.8 and 4.5. She subsequently had an anterior lumbar puncture. The patient was discharged a day later.   The patient was re-admitted to the hospital again after a second lumbar puncture and was discharged on the same day in good condition.   She had a left bundle-branch block at the time of admission to the hospital. Since the block is associated with an increased risk for left bundle branch block during labor and delivery, the patient was admitted to the hospital and began cesarean section (Caesarean section is rarely indicated for AML). She did not lose consciousness and her baby boy did not have severe ventriculomegaly. She was discharged without intervention. Her right bundle branch block is likely caused by a myocardial ischemia and should be managed aggressively by cardiac rehabilitation.   During the labor and delivery, the patient and her husband had strong supportive instructions for her and her baby. However, the patient, while still in labor and delivery, was admitted to the hospital due to her husband's agitation, hostility, and inattentiveness. The patient, despite the patient's efforts, had difficulty maintaining uterine contractions. After the patient had recovered, the patient and her husband returned home to find she was pregnant again. The pregnancy was planned to be aborted in the hospital setting due to the risk of C-section. The delivery was successful and the baby is alive.   Myocardial Elect"
