**PROMPT:**

Plan of Treatment:  The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist

**RESPONSE:**

 . He or she may be referred for a chest tube to drain mucus from the lungs or possibly a bronchoscopy to see the lung function. The patient's symptoms continue to subside and he or she may need to continue to take at least 3 months of prednisone daily to avoid pulmonary edema.  Treatment Advice:  The patient should be instructed to avoid high-sugar foods and drinks and to limit his or her alcohol intake to one drink per day, although alcohol is often taken along with a meal. The patient should also be encouraged to stop smoking.  Precautions:  The patient should also reduce his or her high-fat intake.  Drug Interactions:  Sodium benzoate can be taken with medications that contain siderophores, such as aspirin, naproxen, warfarin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, siderophores have been reported to interfere with the absorption of aspirin.  Other Drugs and Medications Contraindicating Antihistamines  Interactions between some medications and amitriptyline are discussed here. For a list of other medications with interactions, click here.  Toxicology  Antihistamines are chemically related to the drug penicillin and are known by several abbreviations. The amitriptyline family includes amitriptyline, nortriptyline, amitropium, and etodolac.  Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  No carcinogenic or mutagenic effects, reproductive toxicity or impairment of fertility have been found in male rats at oral doses of up to 5,000 and 7,000 mg/kg/day, respectively, and in rat studies, 4,100 and 6,700 mg/kg/day of anticholinergic drug was tested.  The mutagenic effects of anticholinergics have been investigated in two studies in laboratory mammals. The oral administration of 10,000 mg/kg/day was not genotoxic (that is, did not produce abnormal chromosome segregation) in the short-tailed opossum and mouse, and no chromosome abnormalities were detected in the mouse (Hornung et al., 1981). In another study, the use of a variety of anticholinergic drugs inhibited chromosomal maintenance of the mouse ovary as well as inducing chromosomal instability, but only in long
