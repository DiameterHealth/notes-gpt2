**PROMPT:**

H&P EXAMINATION The patient is a 78 year old female with a history of stroke and hypertension. She recently fell in her home and reports dizziness and lightheadness

**RESPONSE:**

  (tremors). Her right arm is numb, and her left foot is unsteady. She has a small left leg and a non-throbbing left femoral artery. No other abnormalities are present. Her family has two children. Her symptoms began 2 days earlier when she fell down and lost her balance on the way to the bathroom. She described the fall as "very light and like a 'pop.' A little like being hit by a big wave." She awoke in the middle of the night with headache and dizziness, but she could not recall the fall. She has had mild dizziness and difficulty walking with some difficulty for many years. She was treated with benzodiazepines (Valium, Xanax) for an episode 3 months before the present trip. Her husband went with her to get x-rays. Her right hand was red and warm, and her pulse was 80/75. Her right foot was swollen to 40 mm in a 4 x lognormal pattern. She also had a large number of small tender points on her right flank. On the examination, she was alert. Her left leg was unsteady. Her right thigh was not stiff. The pain was slight, fluctuated, and was relieved by warm compresses. She was found to have a small, non-throbbing, left femoral artery, which is normally not painful, but has been tender to the radiologist since she fell down, and not been the usual finding up until the present time. Her family's previous history of hypertension suggests that it is related to recent blood loss. The right hand and foot were warm (not normal), and the hand was almost swollen. They could see no tenderness or other abnormality in the left leg. She had no pain with her right knee when the radiologist measured it. The examination did not reveal any pathology, and the patient did not have a neurologic examination. This patient has been on at least three different medications, one an NSAID (Oxyburant, Vibramycin), one an antiplatelet (Warfarin, Jantoven), and one an antidepressant (amitriptyline, Elavil). No other medications are known to cause this problem. She reported to the hospital before the trip to have been taking Vibramycin with acetaminophen for headache. She said that she had not thought twice about taking this or any other anti-inflammatory medications without first doing a careful blood analysis to know which one had the lowest
