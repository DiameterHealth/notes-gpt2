**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE:**

  The patella appears to be calcified, so a thorough examination to assess for patellofemoral pain is not required.  If a lateral rotation assessment is found, the hip is flexed and elevated (elevated for the patellar component which does not have calcified synovium and may be very soft, and for the flexed knee), the knee is flexed, then flex again, then flex once more, followed by internal rotation, then extensor flexion.  Note: There may be flexors and extensors of different parts of the leg, for example, femur and tibia. It is important not to attempt to evaluate the ligamentous structures of the femur without first evaluating a knee. In the case of the knee, it is very important to perform a thorough examination of the ACL and PIV of the femur, and extensor and flexor musculature of the tibia. There is also likely to be flexor and extensor instability of the patella. In patients with femoral tibia and meniscus lesions, they may need to be re-evaluated for patellar dislocations before an assessment of knee flexion.  Imaging: In some patients with patellar dislocations, the patellofemoral pain is seen with either MRI or ultrasound, in which case imaging of the patellofemoral joint is performed. However, in most cases, there is no pain or dysfunction detected with MRI. In children, there may be a more obvious finding with ultrasound, the patellofemoral joint.  If the patient is found to have a bony lesion or weakness in the patella, the patient may not have patellofemoral pain and thus diagnostic imaging is not required, but there is an increased possibility of bony involvement and patellar instability. If the bone changes have calcified in the joint, imaging of the ligamentous structures of the knee, and the femur is done. There may be some bony involvement.  Cephalic Version: The patient and parents sign a form giving consent for a cephalic version examination using ultrasound. The patient has a cephalic version and radiographs are performed as described above, and additional imaging tests of the ligamentous structures of the femur, knee, and tibia are typically done to diagnose ligamentous instability and/or bony pathology.
