PROMPT:

Assessment / Plan: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

The patella appears to be calcified, so a thorough examination to assess for patellofemoral pain is not required. If a lateral rotation assessment is found, the hip is flexed and elevated (elevated for the patellar component which does not have calcified synovium and may be very soft, and for the flexed knee), the knee is flexed, then flex again, then flex once more, followed by internal rotation, then extensor flexion.
