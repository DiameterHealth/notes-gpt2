**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.

**RESPONSE:**

  Although this was thought to be a life threatening emergency with the patient on a ventilator, the paramedics and emergency department staff decided this would be best for the patient, rather than have the patient ventilated by itself. She was still on life support as there was a significant risk of pulmonary hemorrhage from this life threatening event that may or may not have been directly caused by the pulmonary edema and the subsequent cerebral edema. The cardiology team could not predict what the outcome would be with or without care in this setting of the underlying disease.  Cardiac Arrest: Although no cardiac arrest was considered, there was a risk of cardiac arrest with the patient on a ventilator with the patient in a coma with her heart rhythm not yet being well defined. Due to the lack of cardiopulmonary resuscitation that we could provide, the decision was made that care was to be terminated immediately and the patient transported to a cardiac catheterization center, where our physicians continued life support with intravenous fluids until cardiopulmonary resuscitation could be provided.  What is the prognosis for someone with a severe ventricular arrhythmia or heart attack?  The prognosis for the patient with a severe ventricular arrhythmia or a life threatening cardiac arrest is not likely to be good. There will be no significant reduction in the potential for permanent disability, as this would be unlikely to have been expected in an acute state. Therefore, a decision should always be made on the basis of clinical assessment of the case. The best chance for survival in these cases is to be admitted to a hospital where rapid sequence intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be achieved. It is also essential to have chest X rays and a cardiac MRI performed within hours of the cardiac arrest, as these studies will identify the cause of the heart failure. Although these are more complicated than the simple EFA scan, they will give an important picture of the cause of injury for future decisions, e.g.: is this an acute myocardial infarction, or is this from a second or third cause?  Please provide additional information regarding your hospital.  My patient had a severe ventricular arrhythmia or a cardiac arrest. I am unable to provide more information regarding the hospital.  My patients had these cardiac events, but there are more details available on the website for these or the patient's personal information.  A few more details regarding one of my patients is provided below.  The
