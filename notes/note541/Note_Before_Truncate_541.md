**PROMPT:**

HPI The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

**RESPONSE:**

  The patient has no other obvious medical problems.   Patient reports symptoms of GERD, but the history is consistent with obstructive sleep apnea.   The patient's primary symptom is that they have a hard time falling asleep. Patient reports worsening symptoms of GERD from the medication and asks for a trial of BID.   The HAPI uses 3 of the 4 criteria listed to diagnose GERD, as a way to rule in and rule out other possible causes of GERD.   The HAPI confirms the diagnosis of GERD and is the most sensitive test for identifying patients with GERD.   The HAPI is sensitive to an estimated 25% of patients with GERD. The HAPI also is highly specific at identifying patients with BED which is the most common cause of GERD. The HAPI has shown high sensitivity compared to other GERD testing techniques, however the specificity of the test is lower. Most HAPI tests are performed during the morning after the last dose of the medication, so the HAPI may be sensitive to residual medication effect over the night. The HAPI may be less sensitive to other medications that induce sleep (antihistamines, alcohol and caffeine), which may not show the same relationship to sleeping problems as the medication effects of drugs for GERD. SOME TEST FINDINGS Patients with GERD are classified by the size of their soft palate (see image). The image below shows the Soft-palate size criteria. The lower the score, the more GERD a patient has. A patient's BED is determined by a 3-question interview using a modified questionnaire from the National Hospital Discharge Survey of BED . The patient also completes the Sleep Abnormalities Questionnaire NUTRITIONAL RESOURCES  The most common medications that can be used to treat GERD are: A diet low in fiber and low in fat, and high in monounsaturated fats.   If you have taken antihistamines, try lowering them and see if the GERD improves. If you take other medications for GERD such as blood pressure medications, antidepressants, or sedatives, try lowering them.   You may have a thyroid problem ( go to a doctor for a complete physical ).   Vitamin D is helpful for GERD.   A review by the American College of Gastroenterology indicates that in individuals over 65 years of age, the most common cause of GERD is hypothyroidism.   Vitamin D
