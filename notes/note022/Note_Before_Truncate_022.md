Pt will be discharged by Wednesday and the family has no other plans for him because he was not required in hospital, Ms Gannon said. She said their plan was to bring him back to the UK to live with them. They were also in touch with the Department of Immigration to obtain Mr Bikubi's visa so he could be reunited with his family at school.  Mr Bikubi left home at the age of 19 to attend a university in London. He then moved back to Tanzania before becoming involved in the campaign against forced removals after his friend was murdered in July 2015. Mr Bikubi, who lives in a shanty town on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam, was killed when a fire started in a house. In April 2016, the United Nations reported that the number of forced relocations had more than doubled over 2014, adding the number of people being deported under the government's policy to 1,300 for the 2015 tax year.

On the fifth anniversary of his death, Mr Bikubi's mother said the government needed to ensure it had the ability to intervene if there was an emergency. "He was trying to protect the rights of many other people like him," she said. "Because he had nothing, he was willing for them to have anything," said his mother, who uses only one name. Ms Ganna Bikubi, Mr Bikubi's father, said they had had their own doubts about the government when they met in Dar es Salaam earlier this year.

"We demand that the government provide transparent and accurate information about the details and causes. We urge the Government to fully cooperate with this body and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in its investigations into the matter," UNYSUR secretary general, Joseph G. Oduh, said. UNYSUR also asked the international community to support the Tanzanian Government and ensure the full protection of human rights victims. The UN report has been strongly
