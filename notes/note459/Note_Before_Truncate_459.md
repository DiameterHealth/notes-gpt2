**PROMPT:**

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  This is a follow-up visit from prior encounter for back pain. The patient is continuing physicial therapy and OTC medications to manage the pain

**RESPONSE:**

 . The purpose of this check is to gather a history of back pain as well as evaluate the patient's back pain. For this reason, the back pain is often not considered in the patient's history review. The primary symptoms include persistent muscle or soft tissue pain and stiffness.  Physical Exam Physical examination of the patient is based on a standardized pattern. The exam takes place at a comfortable, sedentary height. An appropriate range of motion and range of motion has been calculated to assess the condition of the spine (for example, a straight or curved spine is evaluated as being within the normal range of motion in this context to detect any signs of cervical instability or ligamentous laxity). A cervical spine x-ray is obtained if the patient is younger than age 60 years or if there are indications that the cervical spine may show signs of injury. The cervical spine is then palpated for the presence of any abnormal changes including pain and disc herniation. The physician is interested in documenting pain and tenderness in the lumbar and sacrospinal regions. The physician should note any numbness or lack of response on the patient's back, and the physician should watch for swelling on the patient's back. The physician should also note any changes in muscle strength observed at the start of the physical exam and if noted, the degree to which the muscle is being controlled. If the patient has back symptoms, the physician may also request a neuro-imaging study.  Anatomy and Skeletal System Evaluation The examination may focus on identifying the degree of injury, if any, and the amount of disc herniations in order to ensure treatment is appropriately aimed. The examination then may include the assessment of the spine joint and cervical spine. The head of the femur may be inspected to ensure the level of the femoral neck and lumbar spine. If there are signs of trauma, the physician should note those and review the patient's history including any other symptoms related to the injury. The neuro-imaging study may involve the examination of any regions of the brain from the pons to the cerebrum, the cervical spine with an MRI, the spine with a CT scan (if the patient is older than age 60 years), or a combination of x-ray and MRI to evaluate the spine.  Dental Examination The teeth may be inspected for damage or missing teeth. The following questions are designed to screen for dental problems, as well as any injuries. A comprehensive review of the crown may also be used to screen for
