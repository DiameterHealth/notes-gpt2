**PROMPT:**

HPI The patient presents with a fever and shortness of breath associated with community acquired pneumonia

**RESPONSE:**

 . The patient has a history of smoking and drinking beer in addition to a history of chronic pancreatitis. The patient has a history of smoking 2–4 g/day. The patient was a heavy drinker. He also smoked heavily. All subjects were instructed to abstain from smoking for the next 24 h. They were also instructed to continue with low calorie consumption. The patient smoked 2–3 cigarettes in the early morning. A second cigarette was initiated at 8 am in the evening. No cough or sputum emanated from the patient during the initial 2 h post ingestion. However after 7 hours no cough emanated. A post-intragastric blood sample was collected 30 min post ingestion. He developed a severe upper respiratory tract infection at that time.  HPI/HPI/MIA The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis. He smokes moderately and has abstained from alcohol. He has a history of moderate alcohol abuse. Both of his parents were heavy (13 beers/week) beer drinkers and also smoked heavily. He was also a heavy drinker in his teens (3–4 bottles in a week) and did not develop an upper respiratory tract infection. He has also been diagnosed with COPD when he was 16. Two days before ingestion in the evening the patient has a cough with sputum emanation from the sinuses. On examination there is a well developed upper respiratory tract infection. The patient's history of severe upper respiratory tract infections in the last several years makes us suspect CIPE. He has been admitted to the hospital due to a persistent cough since the previous admission and this cough will not subside. After taking samples of cough and sputum fluids for culture, he is taken to the hospital emergency room. He is admitted to an airway-challenged (EC) unit and placed in a ventilator due to his cough. No additional cultures are obtained (EC) for CIPE.  TREATMENT The patient was taken by ambulance to the emergency room. Despite a normal cough, the patient is not improving and is breathing heavily. On admission he is placed on an induced rest with fluids and electrolytes. After discharge from the emergency room he is placed on a drip of IV fluids and antibiotics. A chest x-ray showing a massive pneumoplegic area is taken. It is clear that the patient has a CIPE infection. The patient is seen in the operating room as an inoperative patient. He has significant airway obstructions and
