PROMPT:

Assessment & Plan:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

His electrocardiogram reveals right bundle-branch block which was consistent with a TIA. His pulse oximeter is elevated but at 90% of the baseline. His pulse rate is 50/min with a rhythm of 75/min with an R-waves. He was on no medication. Diagnostic Consideration:  This is a classic example of an acute ST-segment depression.
