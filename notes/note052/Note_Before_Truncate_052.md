**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care

  physician.  Discussion / Conclusion: This finding is consistent with other case reports of anaphylaxis attributed to honey; however, several factors should be considered when assessing if the patient is at high risk for anaphylaxis. This case demonstrates the importance of continuing appropriate diagnostic surveillance, such as a clinical reaction checkup or physical exam, even if there is no immediate risk of anaphylaxis following the food. The patient's parents should inform their pediatrician if they have a history of allergy to bees or other pollens. In the future, all honey should be clearly labeled as a food with appropriate warnings and restricted access to children and pregnant women (CDC 2013).  Follow Up:  During the acute illness, ask about the occurrence of food allergic urticaria as well as oral dermatitis.  If signs of serious respiratory or cardiac depression develop (such as syncope, shortness of breath, or an abnormal cardiac rhythm), call 911.  References / Further Reading  Venturi E., et al.
