**PROMPT:**

HPI Comments 25 y/o F presents to the ED with R knee pain and bilateral ankle pain following a fall. Pt states she fell down x2 steps onto cement. States she twisted her ankles and R knee.

**RESPONSE:**

  Pt states she fell forward and landed on her right knee with the right lateral. She stated she could not remember falling onto her right knee. Pt states she can't remember if she hit her head or landed on her knee. Pt states she has pain now in both her ankles and knee and soreness in R knee. There are multiple injuries to the right lateral side of her right knee and pain/stiffness with the use of her right hand. The PT stated "She has had a lot of surgery to fix this." (R = 5, 2F = 5) The PT stated that he feels good about her condition and thinks she will have a good outcome. He recommended she be seen by the end of the week to make sure the swelling goes down. There is a possibility of arthritis. The left lateral thigh pain on T21S1 is very similar to the pain observed on right lateral thigh on W25S1: it includes the calf, bicep muscles, medial and lateral gastrocnemius, quadriceps femoris, and medial gastrocnemius tendons, fascia, and the medial aspect of the tibialis anterior (Fig 8, Table 3). At a glance, the pain on right lateral thigh might be the same as the patient's R knee pain. However, the pain on T21S1 is a bit harder to diagnose because the patient is having trouble walking. There are different approaches to diagnose posterior tibial stress fracture at the tibial head. There is no diagnostic imaging to diagnose tibial head stress fracture, apart from MRI, and even then the patient may suffer from a severe pain (Kocer, 2015). At a glance, the patient's pain at the tibial head seems similar to the patient's pain on right lateral thigh (Fig 8, Table 3). There are several possible explanations for the patient's pain at the left lateral thigh: The patient could be having an arthritic condition (in which case the patient's pain at the left knee may be due to the patient's lower legs being affected by the arthritis.)  The patient did something especially painful, like fall backwards and land on her left knee; this will cause the right leg to move forward too. If the patient is walking with her left foot elevated, she will not be wearing high heels or have her heels pushed up as would cause the pain on her right leg. If a patient is walking with her left foot elevated, she will be wearing high heels or putting
