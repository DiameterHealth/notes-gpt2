**PROMPT:**

HPI Comments This is a follow-up visit from prior encounter for back pain. The patient is continuing physicial therapy and OTC medications to manage the pain

**RESPONSE:**

 . On the back, there were no changes noted that would suggest any additional problems such as disc degeneration or instability. This visit shows the patient had normal function prior to the back pain. The therapist is continuing to provide ongoing physical therapy to help facilitate muscle strengthening.  Back Pain in the Adult  There are a number of different causes of back pain in adults. The primary cause is often a physical problem in the body that is either not corrected or not adequately treated. These physical problems are often due to an imbalance in the body's autonomic (or "internal") nervous system (ANS). ANS can be found throughout the body. It is a part of the "fight or flight" system that causes us to prepare for a variety of possible threats, but also for important tasks.  Autonomic function is often impaired in the aging elderly due to lack of muscle mass, increased strain on joints, and decreased flexibility. Overactive and dysfunctional vagal nerve endings in the body cause the pain (Figure 1). The vagus nerve is the largest and most important of the vagal nerves, extending into the head and neck and in the arm and leg, as well as spinal nerves which extend into and into the heart. The vagus nerve is most active when we are in pain or discomfort, and it stimulates many nerves throughout the body. The nerves of the vagus can signal one leg to go through a full squat, or one leg to stop in the middle of a movement.  What is Nerve Damage?  As mentioned earlier, the autonomic nervous system is comprised of nerve fibers that travel throughout the body, transmitting information about sensations in our body and the situation in which the body finds itself (Figure 2). Nerves are "broken" when damage occurs.  Because the vagus nerve is so important, nerve damage may create back pain in an adult. The vagus nerves in the leg and the arm send signals to the nucleus vagus nerve located in a region called the sacroiliac joint (Laposky 2000). This sends messages to the brain about pain in our lower limbs. Brain signals about pain are relayed to the muscles. There is also a portion of the body that has no nerves. Although this remains an unknown area of the disease, it may be that the nerves that run from the head to the feet are not affected by damage, or that the nerves in this spot are less important. It is possible that those areas are much less affected, perhaps since they do not reach
