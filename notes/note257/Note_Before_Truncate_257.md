**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making (MDM): After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

**RESPONSE:**

  After a short waiting period, patient was allowed to return to work in a job requiring physical contact with coworkers. In the next two years, following a short recurrence on follow-up exam, the patient experienced significant worsening. Over the next 12 months, the patient underwent a surgical procedure to insert a port on his abdomen. During this procedure, which involved the removal of the tumor, the patient experienced moderate-to-severe bleeding, which resulted in extensive local tissue damage and the complete removal of the tumor.  At about 8 months post-operative, the patient's bleeding episodes were reduced and he experienced a normal weight. In October, 2018, the patient experienced a severe pain from his hip that lasted for 2 hours. He went to the oncologist, who determined that the patient had a malignant melanoma. The oncologist advised the patient that he needed to be tested for additional cancers. In October, 2018, the patient experienced severe abdominal swelling and abdominal pain that lasted for almost a couple hours. On the same day, the patient underwent surgery to remove his entire right leg. The remainder of a 3-year-old leg was removed.  Surgery was unsuccessful in removing other lung metastases, and his tumor was confirmed to be a high grade grade 3 melanoma.  In February, 2019, the patient experienced a fever and rash but was in good health. A physical examination revealed that his tumors were completely gone.  Following the surgery, the patient's cancer continued to recur. In April of 2019, he experienced a sudden increase in fevers and his fever recurred, which led to another surgery to remove part of the right leg that had lost its entire weight. He underwent a further surgery to remove two tumors on his upper and lower extremities to ensure no growths existed in those areas. Following this surgery, the patient's cancer had been completely destroyed. The patient's quality of life returned to normal in July and that's when Dr. Ojeda began caring for the patient at The Clinic in the Bahamas. He continued to undergo follow-up exams and follow-up treatment. At about the time of his last follow-up in December 2019, the patient experienced a sudden illness that was not related to his cancer but still caused him concern.  The patient was given medical treatment for some weeks before being discharged. The following month, the patient was admitted to The Clinic for a biopsy after noticing a small lump in his right kidney. In February
