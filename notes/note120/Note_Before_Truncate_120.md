**PROMPT:**

AP:  The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

**RESPONSE:**

 . If all goes well, he should remain out of the hospital, although the next scheduled visit will likely be up to two weeks later. If an infection is identified, an antibiotic may either be added to the antibiotics already taken, or he will be kept off antibiotics until he becomes symptom free. The PCP will provide information about what to expect if such a complication does arise, and to be reassured if the patient expresses concern about his health.  POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING RESPONSES  CPR: The best chance for survival is when the injury, as little as possible, has been treated. If the patient has taken aspirin, the bleeding was slowed. The bleeding stopped in about 50% of cases, although the remaining 50% required an anticoagulant (in some cases, even after receiving the aspirin), a blood transfusion, or both.  DVT: In the majority of cases, the patient became a "lucky" survivor, whose blood type was A or AB, and he received first-line drugs in an attempt to prevent a potentially fatal transfusion.  DETECTION: If a hemodynamic crisis develops, the decision as to whether to perform CXR or PFT should be based on the assessment at that time. If the patient is at-risk for a major transfusion, the blood type of the potential recipient matters in many cases.  Etiology  The diagnosis of a transfusion-transmitted disease can be quite difficult, even before a potential transfusion. For a patient at risk for receiving a potentially fatal blood transfusion, or for a patient who has an elevated blood transfusion risk profile, the diagnosis can appear obvious at times (i.e., someone with a positive antibody test or a family history). However, the diagnosis is often not so obvious to the non-specialist physicians who treat transfusion-transmitted diseases (TTVDs) patients. It is therefore critical to establish an early diagnosis, even before the patient has been admitted to a hospital.  The following are common etiologies of TTVD-related transfusion-transmitted infections and their complications (see Figure 1-2 for examples):  DVT infection can be caused by several different pathogens. In general, these are:  Vaginal organisms , usually bacteria, that enter the female genital tract by way of the vagina (e.g., Neisseria gonorrhoeae ), or the
