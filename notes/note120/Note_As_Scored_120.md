**PROMPT:**

AP:  The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

. If all goes well, he should remain out of the hospital, although the next scheduled visit will likely be up to two weeks later. If an infection is identified, an antibiotic may either be added to the antibiotics already taken, or he will be kept off antibiotics until he becomes symptom free. The PCP will provide information about what to expect if such a complication does arise, and to be reassured if the patient expresses concern about his health.
