PROMPT:

HPI Comments Patient is being seen today for her obstetrical visit. She is at 27w0d weeks gestation. Patient reports no complaints, no bleeding, no leaking, no contractions.

RESPONSE:

  Her fetal ultrasound exam is normal. She had a late pregnancy scan and was given DCH. Her body mass index (BMI) is 13.5. The patient weighs 106 kg with a height of 1.65 m. No abnormalities of blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, or oxygen saturation have been described or observed during this exam. The obstetrical consultation is complete, she is in the hospital for a final exam, and is scheduled to be discharged the following day. A routine urine sample was obtained for testing blood glucose level that is 10.2 mmol/L. Total PSA of 5.6 ng/mL was obtained and the patient is expected to have no problems in her pregnancy. We are providing the patient a total of $1,500 as payment for this evaluation. This evaluation is performed in accordance with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of maternal hyponatremia (see ACOG Recommendations for the Evaluation and Treatment of Maternal Hyponatremia [http://www.acog.org/journals/jrpp/pdf/1_6%20108-0029.pdf]. This evaluation should be performed by a healthcare provider who is experienced with the evaluation of patients with maternal hyponatremia. We would welcome your further input on the appropriateness of this assessment for this patient. We believe this is appropriate medical advice, and any questions at this time would be appreciated.  I read an article that mentioned the use of the glucose tolerance test as one of the tools that we may wish to use to assess the risk for pregnancy in a woman who has been diagnosed as having preeclampsia. Is this an effective test or should we look to other methods like HCG monitoring or serum sulfate measurement rather than glucose testing? Thanks for your help.
