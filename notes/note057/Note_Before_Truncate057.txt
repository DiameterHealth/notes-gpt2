PROMPT:

Assessment / Plan: The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection

RESPONSE:

 . A large portion of pt was advised to take medication, preferably NSAID that has a low toxicity profile like indomethacin. Ps was managed with a combination of ibuprofen/cetabine, diclofenac/ticlopidine, and piroxicam/sertraline as appropriate, with pt receiving the most effective therapy. The ulcer became a smaller, much easier to treat one for 2 weeks, and then pt was instructed to discontinue all NSAIDs and diclofenac.  Prognosis: There was no improvement in the ulcer; however, pt healed on its own with normal skin.  Comment: The ulcer is usually managed with antibiotic and steroid. Treatment is necessary if the ulcer continues to heal on its own. This was the only treatment documented for ulcer without improvement.
