**PROMPT:**

SUBJECTIVE Patient presents with cough and states he has flu like sx since Sunday, feels like he his progressivly getting better. This s is a well appearing male with non-productive cough, headache, chills, subjective fever, muscle aches and flu like symptoms

**RESPONSE:**

 . He states that on Monday he was fine, Tuesday he got febrile, which was his first complaint of cough for 3 days; Wednesday he had no symptoms at all, on friday he was sick. He took antibiotics on friday with no clear improvement (on friday he was sick, took antibiotics with no improvement, on friday felt better, on friday did not take any antibiotics).   Vit C, DMSO, SRT and TGA show posivley that the patient is infected. However the patient is feeling better on friday and has no signs of an infection.. His T-Vap showed that there is some residual viral load in blood, but this is low.   His other labs are not as close together (Vit B is low, pH, Temp and a few other points) This has not been noticed before, and I donÂ´t think this would have been possible to observe.   VACCINE  I have not been able to find a vaccine that would have been able to prevent this event (from vaccine or naturally). The best I found online was the influenza vaccine for children, however this is not a good thing to get right from the start, it is better to wait 2 weeks to start the flu vaccine. So this patient could have caught the virus from someone with flu like sx, he then got vaccinated and then came down with sx.   The infection would have continued in a cycle like this...  If patient was in a room with 1 person sxing then would be sx first and maybe the infection would take hold. I can never say that someone will go into isolation and not get sick but this might not have happened with this patient.  If patient was in room with 1 patient sxing then infection may have occurred before the vaccine got into the system as many people will have sxed first and come down with Sx later on.  On Friday a few days ago this patient was with family and his wife had fever which went away on friday and he has had no symptoms. At this time I am assuming the infection took hold before the vaccinations got into the system.  I am thinking of giving a full dose of influenza vaccine to him. The patient might think that this is like some people in India get vaccine and it makes them ill. For all I know this is not the case, but given the fact he was feeling better and did not have any infections and that only one
