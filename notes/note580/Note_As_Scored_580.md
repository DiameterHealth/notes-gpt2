and heptic asthmatic episodes. He is admitted to hospital for observation, but does not survive. A review of his laboratory studies reveals significant hemolysis. He was found to have a blood loss of 1 ml/0.1 L and a creatinine-to-creatinine ratio of 1.2. He also had a low serum lactate concentration (23.7 mmol/l), a concentration which is of significant concern as it can compromise survival.[4] A lactic acidosis is unlikely due to lack of fluid volume and an increase in oxygen consumption (by approximately 25% above the arterial blood volume)[1] A lactate dehydrogenase activity test in the critically ill patient without evidence of hypothermia (by using pH as the measure of acidosis) should be considered for future case, given the findings of blood loss and increase in lactate dehydrogenase.
