**PROMPT:**

SUBJECTIVE The patient is a 57 y.o. male presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath

**RESPONSE:**

 . The initial presentation was from a workplace accident or some sort of domestic incident. He has experienced nausea and vomiting and a dry cough. His initial physical exam revealed a tachypnoea and he had a very short pulse. We performed a respiratory history. He had a previous history of asthma and emphysema. The patient's ECG was recorded as below.  As you can see, the ECG displayed the following:  The patient had a short T-wave and SP conduction.   The SP is present in all tachycardias, it appears to be a compensatory response to a longer T-wave.  In the previous article in our series, we demonstrated that the short SP is a common and easy to differentiate feature.   We explained how it differs from shorter SP atrial refractory rhythm (SLDRP) and a longer SP:  In SLDRP, the SP is present but the conduction velocity is not sufficient to activate the atrial membrane. Here, a rapid lengthening of the atrial membrane is necessary, usually the duration of SLDRP is longer than the initial duration of QRS widening but is still of sufficient duration to allow the SP to be initiated. The conduction velocity of SLDRP is typically less than 0.1m/s (10 -30cm/s; typical SLDRP is 0.8m/s although a larger conduction velocity is sometimes seen. SLDRP is commonly seen during cardiac arrest)   We then described the other SP:  The ST segment depression (ST depression) is the most commonly seen ST segment abnormality in patients with a STEMI and is often present as a ST-segment depression of <1 mm  The ST segment elevation is observed in as many as 1 in 6 patients and is characterized by an elevation of >2 mm in atrial diameter.  The ST depression is an indication of a left-sided ventricular tachycardia in patients without a known cause of ventricular tachycardia   The ST depression is a simple change that can only be clearly seen with a good electrocardiogram (ECG) and usually represents a conduction-mediated atrial arrhythmia or an arrhythmia that has spontaneously developed into a ventricular tachycardia . This simple finding can also sometimes appear transiently in the inferior myocardium during the initial ECG and will disappear when the ST segment is re
