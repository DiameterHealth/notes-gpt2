PROMPT:

AP:  Follow-up in 3 months

RESPONSE:

  to address concern that initial treatment was sufficient. No difference between groups at follow-up. Â H.E.T. = hepatitis E viral load. D = reduced, R.E. = reduced, or no treatment. There were no significant changes in the baseline variables from baseline to the beginning of follow-up (P = 0.15). There were no differences between groups (P = 0.62). At 3 months both groups increased their viral load (P = 0.008) and remained at higher levels. At 12 months they remained lower at the last study visit (P = 0.02) and at 3 years there was no difference between groups (P = 0.94). At 12 months the average reduction in H.E.T among the three groups was 24.3 (95%, confidence interval [CI], 15.8-31.5) of the original value and the mean value after one year of treatment was 22.4 (95%, CI, 14.3-27.8). There was a slightly greater reduction after three years (24.2) compared with two (23.1). Changes in H.E.T over the three years were not influenced by treatment (P = 0.58). In this particular study all participants were receiving a combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, but in the largest randomized study in the UK (Study 7) only one-third of the participants were prescribed pegylated interferon and none were prescribed ribavirin. No side effects from treatment in this study were reported. More information is available on the Study 7 Registry ( https://www.registry.cam.ac.uk/people/C.B.Dell/study). In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has approved ribavirin treatment for patients who are infected with HIV (RV-1) or HBV (HIV-1), who do not respond to pegylated interferon (IFN) and who have an Hb level greater than 10,000 copies/mL, but not RV-2 or RV-3. (See the FDA website and the Drugs.gov site for more information.) In patients infected with these three viruses, treatment with Ribavirin can reduce the Hb level to below 10,000 copies/mL and eliminate most of the remaining virus. If this level is not reached within 2 to 12 months of stopping Ribavirin treatment (with an alternate drug), the
