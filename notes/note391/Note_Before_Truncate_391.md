**PROMPT:**

HPI Patient reports gassy and bloated feeling and has had irregular stools over the past two week 

**RESPONSE:**

 ................................. Vomiting was intermittent (occurred during meal) but had few (sometimes many) small cramping attacks throughout the duration of the meal.  4:36 PM  Dr. R - Gastroparesis was diagnosed based on the physical examination, patient history, labs and urine/blood samples.  3:41 PM  Dr. R. Gastroparesis – I have some concerns about your patient history and lab testing, do you have any concerns regarding them.  3:28 PM – She's doing well and has been since she was discharged from the hospital.  2:15 PM - Dr R has been in communication with the patient via email regarding his progress and other notes.   Dr. R's initial note:  She has had very few bowel movements the last 4 days. Not sure whether this is related to the treatment or is just part the disease.  6:40 PM – Patient is doing great but still has some problems with the gastrointestinal symptoms, she has some constipation and I am hoping she'll pick up steam soon.  7:55 PM – Patient is feeling better all day and is able to have her first bowel movement!  9:00 PM – Dr. R, the Gastroenterologist, and I met to review the patient's symptoms and do a more comprehensive assessment. During this meeting we reviewed her laboratory results including her hemoglobin levels (including red blood cell counts). She also performed some lab tests to rule out infections. The patient is doing well and is doing well with the gastroenterologist's treatment plan.  5:33 PM – They need to keep the patient off of all medications to limit the stress on her system. They're starting to work with her to get to her gut bacteria which will decrease the inflammation in her colon. This can slow down the production of the toxins produced by the body causing a slower and more gradual decline in symptoms like her colon.  I'm not even doing IVs, no NSAIDs, or anything to worsen her symptoms (including antibiotics to reduce bacteria in her bowel). She's on liquid nutrition with a balanced diet that provides her with all of the proper nutrients she needs to maintain good GI function. There is also the chance that antibiotics could trigger a bacterial infection and her condition would worsen. We will monitor her as she continues her course of antibiotics, but her symptoms, along with all of the other variables, are making sure that the treatment plan works.
