PROMPT:

SUBJECTIVE Patient presents with a fever, sore throat and overall unwell. Symptoms reported to start 5 days ago and fever has been persistent and treated with acetaminophen

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

.  • How likely is this patient's fever to be a symptom of a more serious disease? • How likely is it that the fever was caused by some other cause: flu syndrome? I would consider the above questions relevant to patients with fever who present to the ED with chest pain. This patient's symptoms had been described as typical of influenza.
