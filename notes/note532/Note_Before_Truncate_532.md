 .  • How likely is this patient's fever to be a symptom of a more serious disease?  • How likely is it that the fever was caused by some other cause: flu syndrome?  I would consider the above questions relevant to patients with fever who present to the ED with chest pain. This patient's symptoms had been described as typical of influenza. As noted earlier, flu is not uncommon in the summer, even in areas of the United States where seasonal influenza influenza activity has not begun (Bennett et al., 2003; Blum et al., 2004). The patient was a healthy, healthy adult, living in a warmer zone, and not immunocompromised, so the case was not necessarily influenza-like. I also noted that the patient had developed fever over a few days, but her symptoms resolved the next day.  When I spoke to her, she had no fever. She explained that her daughter's fever was "the first thing that came to my mind," and that it was not only her daughter's fever that she expected to occur, but others. It took her a few minutes to recall the other children in her neighborhood who also had fever, with no fever. She described her daughter's fever as extremely high, but her temperature was within acceptable limits to be diagnosed as influenza (Bennett et al., 2003). Her daughter's clinical course was quite similar to that of the patients in my original series whose histories matched mine (Gillis et al., 1999). The patient was seen again 5 days later for the same conditions and had a similar fever. She is a 6-year-old Caucasian girl with no past history of the influenza virus. I did not consider her a high-risk patient.  Cases like this one reinforce the concept that the symptoms of "fever day-care syndrome" can result from other causes unrelated to influenza. This case is consistent with the literature of Guillemin et al. (1997), who described 4 patients who presented to the emergency department with the exact same symptoms. None had influenza.  The authors reported similar clinical findings in another series of 10 children and teenagers who had fever on the same day, and none had influenza. However, the patients were sicker and had multiple co-morbidities such as diabetes (3), epilepsy (3), malnutrition (4), or a previous stroke (13).  Fever day-care syndrome has been described in adult populations. In a retrospective review of the literature (Ranney
