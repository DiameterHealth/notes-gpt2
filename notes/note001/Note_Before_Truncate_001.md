**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Plan:  The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

**RESPONSE:**

 .  Outcome Measures: Assessment of depression and symptoms of OCD.  Results: Baseline ratings for total depression and anxiety were 7.7 and 4.7, respectively. Symptom severity was unchanged, and the mean scores for OCD were unchanged, from 4.6 and 5.5 at baseline. However, scores for OCD and depression had markedly increased at follow-up, from 14.6 and 12.2, respectively (P < .05).  Conclusions: The results demonstrate that treatment with MBCR augments symptom severity in OCD. Because this treatment has also been successfully used in obsessive-compulsive disorder, potential harms associated with MBCR should be carefully considered.
