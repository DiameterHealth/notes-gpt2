**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

The physician believes the patient has a transient onset with no apparent cardiac abnormality, and that he may have left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary revascularization. The patient was not a candidate for atrial fibrillation treatment. In the current setting, the physician electively monitors for atrial fibrillation as he did in the current scenario. He believes the patient has atrial fibrillation and is awaiting an emergency cardiac procedure.
