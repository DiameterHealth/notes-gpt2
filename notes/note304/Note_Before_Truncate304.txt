PROMPT:

Plan of Treatment:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

RESPONSE:

  The patient's vitals are as follows: BP 120/80 mmHg, BP 80/50 mmHg, RR 40 bpm. Her heart rate is 150 bpm.   The following are the normal patient results: BP 120/80 mmHg, BP 80/50 mmHg, RR 40 bpm. Her heart rate is 150 bpm.  The ECG showed an ST-segment elevation with a large R-wave (Fig. 12).   Discussion  The use of the LADOT® machine to obtain LADOT® electrodes leads is the first such device to be approved for clinical use.  Currently, a wide range of LADOT® electrodes (for example, 7–14) are available, some of them with a high LADOT® rate and other with a low rate.  The highest rate device with a rate of 100 mA–1.04 mA is available for clinical use at the end of February 2012; its use is restricted to patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, with the same type of ECG on both of the other leads.   Figure 12. A. ECG showing ECG troponin T4 levels. Left is ECG of an atrial fibrillator (a) with a LADOT® rate of 100 mA–1.04 mA; right is ECG of an atrial fibrillator having a LADOT® rate of 50 mA–0.98 mA.  The LADOT® device provides two advantages: first, because it generates the leads at 50 mA and 400 mA, it is suitable in patients with slow rate LADOT® electrodes (≤25 mA–1.12 mA) that cannot be obtained using current CPA equipment or in patients with relatively slow rate LADOT® electrodes (≤25 mA–0.98 mA). Moreover, since the lead generator is self-expanding, it can be used in patients with very high-rate LADOT® electrodes or in patients with very high-rate LADOT® rate who cannot obtain leads because of their arrhythmia.  2.3.2.2 ECG-TOMS®: an alternative to LADOT® leads  TOMS® is a very similar device that works in the same manner as LADOT® (Fig. 13); however,
