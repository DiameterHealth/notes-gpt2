**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Plan:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction

**RESPONSE:**

  and stable coronary artery disease. Patient is on an intensive intensive therapy protocol and is being transferred from cardiac catheterization to surgical site after a 3 hour procedure. Initial presentation is mild hypertension (140/84), dyspnea (17/30), and chest pain (15/30) with acute-phase response. Her initial symptoms resolved without admission admission. She received intravenous phenobarbital and ticlopidine which were started at 2:00pm and continued till 11 pm. At 11pm the ECG and blood pressure were unremarkable. On admission to the hospital 1 hour later cardiac examination demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 126 bpm with Q waves in the precordial leads (T2, T3). Her sinus rhythm improved slightly to 115 bpm. ECG showed ST segment depression in the anterior leads with non-ST depression T waves. She was in a non-diffused left anterior MI and her heart rate was 116/min with no ST depression, Q waves in the anterior leads, and a systolic pressure of 118 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure of 97 mm Hg. ECG was repeated on admission and her pulse (BPR) was 105 bpm and her QRS was 10 ms. Her ECG was repeated on admission 3 times with worsening symptoms. On admission she was intubated and sedated to prevent cardiac arrest but no respiratory distress and normal ECG were obtained in her first admission. She was then intubated and ventilated with a tidal volume of 40 liters with a CPAP (3 breaths/min). She had received a pacemaker at the time of her first admission. During the stay we monitored her with continuous echocardiograms. At 5:45 pm ET and again 5:45 am on October 24, 2000 she was admitted to the coronary care unit having left-stern deviation of the mitral valve with mitral valve prolapse. The patient's CPAP was raised, she was sedated with a fentanyl nasal spray, and started IV nitrous oxide and norepinephrine. She developed hypotension, tachycardia, apnea with low tidal volume, and cardiac arrest. She was revived with mechanical ventilation, ventilatory support, and intubation. The patient was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for further management. There was no further complications and she was discharged on October 24, 2000.  2.
