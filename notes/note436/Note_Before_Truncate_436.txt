PROMPT:

HPI Comments This patient present with symptoms of arthritis and joint pain. He has been taking ibuprofen daily but recently reports pain the morning which has intensified. 

RESPONSE:

  After discussing with the patient and reviewing patient records, he has a diagnosis of an inflamed disc with some inflammatory features. The diagnosis of inflamed disc is likely to be confirmed by pathology reports. A diagnosis of osteoarthritis with a low rate of radiographic improvement may require surgical treatment. The clinician should refer this patient to an orthopedic surgeon to evaluate the patient for a posterior canal or other narrowing in the disc.  1. The radiograph has shown that the disc shows evidence of narrowing leading to some inflammatory changes. The patient is taking ibuprofen which was a mainstay for pain relief during the past 4 years. This patient has undergone a disc MRI in February of this year which has shown no evidence of narrowing.   2. There are other non-inflammatory causes of pain. This clinician should refer this patient to an otorhinolaryngologist to discuss options.
