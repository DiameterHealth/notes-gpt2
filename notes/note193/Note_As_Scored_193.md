**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

.  Management:  There are two types of therapy for depression: psychotherapy (SSRIs and TCAs) and antidepressant medications. If the patient is using psychotherapies, such as SSRIs or TCAs, these are likely to alleviate symptoms quickly. Medications are indicated because medications can slow down the brain and can take days to weeks to work. In that case, antidepressants may be required to reduce symptoms again.
