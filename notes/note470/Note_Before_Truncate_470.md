 . Now, I have a white, dry patch on my upper back, left side of my neck. Nail is chipped. Patient's family member is having some concerns. Patient's family member was aware that the patient received the benzethonium aqueous cream on 4/23/15.  Date of Examination 4/29-5/3/15  Age 65 years of age  Alcoholism 30 mg/d  BMI 25.7  Prior Medication N/A  Prior History of skin reactions N/A  Respiratory Conditions:  No (other than minor cold), respiratory infections, COPD, asthma  Dermatologic Results:  Dark Circles over the face, forehead, upper back  Nail and hair mite infestations  Previous Dermatology Exams:  None  Investigations:  Tests:  Phosphate: 4.5 mg/dL; blood lactate: 11.4 mmol/L   Laboratory Results:  Phosphorate: 4.5 mg/dL; blood lactate: 11.4 mmol/L   Urogenital:  Foul smelling vaginal discharge  Diagnosis:  The patient was found to have a severe case of poisoning from benadryl. The patient's history led to the diagnosis of Acute Toxicology Syndrome.  Initial Management:  The patient was given a dose of the benzethonium aqueous cream (8.4) which was effective but left some redness. A dose of 4.6 mg/dL of thiopental was then given and left behind a pink red-brown area and a slight area of the upper back.  After the treatment the area that had left behind was slightly red but not very red, it did not look like a blister, although the patient could not clearly tell. The patient was given the remaining thiopental as a rescue measure. After the injection the patient continued to have a mild degree of itchiness over the affected area on the lower lip.  The area left behind on the lower lip and upper back is now a pink red-brown area with some slight areas of the upper back that will be sore for the next day or two. There is a small red patch which is small but is more than noticeable on their upper back area.  The patient was instructed to wear a mask
