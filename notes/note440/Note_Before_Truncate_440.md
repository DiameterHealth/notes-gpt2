**PROMPT:**

Past Medical History The patient presents with a fever and shortness of breath associated with community acquired pneumonia

**RESPONSE:**

 . On initial examination the patient has a palpable right upper quadrant pulse but no cardiac rhythm. When the patient is mechanically ventilated, his breathing pattern is rapid, with very slow inspiratory gas exchange. He has a diffuse, tachypnoea-like palmar rigidity which resolves shortly after airway occlusion. The patient's lungs are warm to the touch with a dark red coloration in the pleura with little erythema along the walls. The chest radiograph shows mild pneumothorax with mild pleural effusion. There are no identifiable lesions in the chest radiograph and no evidence of internal bleeding in the chest. The patient's vital signs are: blood pressure, 160/100 mmHg, heart rate at 160 beats / minute, oxygen saturation, 98% on room air, respirations 20 l/min, body temperature 36.5Â°C; electrocardiogram is T-wave flattening, ST elevation of the heart rate, and QRS depression with a QRS duration of less than 50 msec; computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography does not show abnormal findings. The patient is admitted and treated with IV antibiotics and IV antibiotics (30 mg/day) for 24 h. On admission he presents with abdominal distention, abdominal pain, and constipation. Chest radiograph shows mild pneumothorax with mild pleural effusion (in the left upper quadrant). There is no sign of necrosis or injury to the lung tissue by chest radiography, biopsy, or invasive approaches. The patient responds well to intubation and thoracotomy. The patient is extubated with an IV pole with antibiotic therapy and is placed on intravenous fluids. The patient is then given a course of intravenous antibiotics with IV fluids for 24-36 h, followed by a course of oxygen with oral therapy. Three days after discharge the patient has returned with a progressive, insidious cough that has become progressively worse. The patient will continue to cough to a degree consistent with aspiration pneumonia until he is admitted for chest pain. The patient is admitted because of worsening cough, but has no apparent chest illness. The patient will continue to cough until he is admitted for chest pain.  Clinical Presentation Chest pain or difficulty breathing; fever with chest radiograph showing pneumothorax or pleural effusion; pulmonary tuberculosis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; history of myocardial infarction.  Physical Exam Chest radiograph reveals a bilateral, small, dark
