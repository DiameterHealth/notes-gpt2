**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

.  Outcome:  Patient returned home 7 days after admission and showed no recurrence of urethral discharge. Conclusion:  This is one of the worst case scenarios in which ED antibiotic use is appropriate. Most urethral complaints are of such a rare nature that this patient likely would not have been missed if ED antibiotic administration instead relied solely on patient history, examination, and other diagnostic resources.
