**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection

**RESPONSE:**

 .  Outcome:  Patient returned home 7 days after admission and showed no recurrence of urethral discharge.  Conclusion:  This is one of the worst case scenarios in which ED antibiotic use is appropriate. Most urethral complaints are of such a rare nature that this patient likely would not have been missed if ED antibiotic administration instead relied solely on patient history, examination, and other diagnostic resources. Although other urethral findings or symptoms of UTIs should prompt treatment, for this patient, ED antibiotic therapy was not indicated.  This case report describes a case of urethral stricture during outpatient urology treatment with a single 4-week course of cefixime to treat a urinary tract infection.  Background  This patient presented to the outpatient urology clinic of an urban private hospital 3 days after presenting for acute pyelonephritis. Her symptoms included dysuria and urgency.  She had previously visited our outpatient clinic 2 days prior and was given intravenous phenylbutazone to treat her urinary tract infection. She was discharged in good condition.  Patient history  This patient was admitted to an outpatient urology clinic in a private hospital in July 2013. She underwent an initial physical examination, chest radiograph, an endoscopy, and a bladder ultrasound.  On the day of discharge, she had a right kidney stone on her right side that had been repaired.  Examination  The following parameters were assessed at the ED:  Hematology (blood count, electrolytes)  Pelvic exam: the patient's right-sided low back pain developed over 2 days and persisted.  Ultrasound: a normal P3-P4 found on a right axial abdominal ultrasonogram.  Cervical exam: the patient reported no pain or burning when examining the cervix.  Urethral exam: a left urethral stricture was found on the 7th day after admission. At this time (approximately 7 days after admission) a discharge was arranged, but she did not attend.  Instrumentation  For the ultrasound, a 5-T 3-dimensional transducer attached to a 3-dimensional magnetic head mounted probe with a head movement accuracy of 3 cm was used to establish a 3-dimensional view of the pelvis, cervix and uterus.  For the ultrasonography scan, a 40 kV laser was used in the lithotri
