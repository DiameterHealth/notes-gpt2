RESPONSE:

  When we start our examination we notice two  inflamed patches in the scaly area on both sides under the left armpit. There are also a few larger areas of inflammatory  skin  and  white  freckles. The first two areas are located  between  the right hip and  right elbow. The area is about a 4" x 2"  pulp size and  has a soft texture. A light greenish  yellow/orange color in the flesh appears at the surface of some of the areas.  We can see the inflamed areas by magnifying the images. They appear more red/pink at this magnification.  The area of  inflamed skin  appears to be  on the right side of the right armpit. The area of enlarged and inflamed skin  is larger at this magnification.  The color appears to be darker and the flesh  appears white. The skin appears to have become swollen and is  becoming  more  red.  We also see the  small pumpkin seed shaped  hairy tumors which  are  growing under the skin and are  on the right side of the lower arm.   The skin and tumor are separated by the  scales of the fingers. A small cavity appears in  the tumor area. THE EXAMINATION Using a magnifying glass we can see the area of inflamed and swollen skin which appears to be  growing around each of the area. There appear to be small openings under the skin in the skin where the tumor appears to be making a slight insertion.  We can see  pockets of blood on the skin and  the white  freckles appear  to be  snowflakes. We can  notice that at this magnification the tumor areas are  not only  increasing  in size but the skin is  fading over the tumor area. As we  proceed to  observe the biopsy we can  see  the  large  Tumor located in the area of  white inflamed,  pulp filled,  red  and  orange  mottled
