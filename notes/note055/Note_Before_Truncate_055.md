**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days

**RESPONSE:**

 .  Outcome: Continued excellent functional outcomes after 3 years  Comments: Patient has tolerated therapy well.  Significant improvement in symptom scores of FM and chronic pelvic pain syndrome was noted after 4 months of medical treatment, and was maintained for 4 years. The improvement in pain and disability was maintained throughout the study, with a sustained rate of improvement of >70%.  In conclusion, this well-designed RCT found medical treatment of FM plus chronic pelvic pain syndrome to be effective and safe.  The authors point out that, in light of the above limitations, there may be significant room for improvement in the safety and clinical management of women with FM, including those requiring opioidsâ€”a potential problem, given the recent increase in opioid overdose.
