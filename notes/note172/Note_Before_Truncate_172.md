It is important that acute care providers and facilities develop plans for providing medical care and care coordination for this population where adequate clinical services are not available within a local hospital setting. The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of what is currently known of the treatment of acute chest pain. This summary will not be intended to be complete.  METHODS  The patients in this case series were selected at the discretion of the researchers and were either seen in or referred to the emergency department of one of the participating hospital emergency departments. This study was not conducted in accordance with national guidelines.  Patients (N = 35) received evaluation and treatment in a clinical setting in the same area of practice where their chest pain was seen on Friday (the assessment visit) or on Monday (the treatment visit). Patients were evaluated according to the current ACG practices as well as the American College of Chest Physicians recommendations of the management of acute and chronic chest pain. The patients' complaints were all judged as severe enough to warrant treatment in all settings. Patients were considered to have experienced
