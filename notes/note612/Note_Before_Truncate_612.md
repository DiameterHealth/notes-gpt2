  for two days. Patient's vitals fluctuate daily between 92-98F, with a core temperature of 105.4F. Patient's bloodwork shows: Pheochromocytoma - Negative.  - Negative. Oligodendroglioma - Negative.  - Negative. Ectopic Pheochromocytoma - Negative. Additional Laboratory Results Lab Results: Urine Protein, Blood and Platelet counts are normal  The patient will undergo a CT scan of the head and neck to determine any other areas of interest.  A follow up CT scan is requested shortly.  Discussion This case illustrates an aggressive treatment by the treating physician in bringing a patient to the CT for further evaluation after he/she presents with a fever, sore throat for 5 days, and general unwellity. Treatment includes early diagnosis and aggressive antiinflammatories to correct and prevent the inflammatory signs. More information regarding CT imaging for this presentation may be found in the Clinical Overview of CT images for Fever and Vomiting. Back to top  Diagnosis Pheochromocytoma may be diagnosed when there are abnormalities in the blood vessel wall and capillaries of the brain that are apparent in the imaging studies for this condition. In a series of cases reported, pheochromocytomas were observed in patients presenting with a fever.8 In addition to the presence of symptoms, the CT scan could demonstrate abnormalities in the brain's white matter (WM), which is the tissue that controls brain function,9-12 and changes in the blood vessels and vessels supplying oxygen and carbon dioxide to the brain.13 In addition, the patient will be required to have several lab abnormalities including platelet counts, electrolytes, coagulation studies, thyroid function tests, as well as blood chemistry, renal function and urine chemistry on exam, all to identify the cause for the fever, sore throat and general unwellity. The above imaging studies and lab tests are very important in making the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The patient must be able to complete the CT scan and complete additional tests to confirm the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. A more detailed description of diagnostic exam of Pheochromocytoma in Fever may be found in the Clinical Overview of CT scans for Fever and Vomiting. However, the above CT studies also may be used to rule out other possible causes of fever as well. The patient will also be sent to the Neuro-onc
