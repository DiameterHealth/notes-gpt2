. An iris biopsy was performed to explore possible intraocular pathology, and the biopsy was negative for cataract, glaucoma or neovascularization. Discussion The incidence and prevalence of myopia and retinal detachment are high, although the causes are unknown.1 However, recent studies indicate an association between genetic factors and eye disease.2 It has been shown that patients with a family history of myopia or cataracts also have a higher incidence of retinal detachment when compared with patients without this family history.1,3â€“7 Further studies are needed to understand whether this association is causal and to identify possible molecular mechanisms linking genotype and retinal disease.
