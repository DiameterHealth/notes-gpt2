 . An iris biopsy was performed to explore possible intraocular pathology, and the biopsy was negative for cataract, glaucoma or neovascularization.  Discussion The incidence and prevalence of myopia and retinal detachment are high, although the causes are unknown.1 However, recent studies indicate an association between genetic factors and eye disease.2 It has been shown that patients with a family history of myopia or cataracts also have a higher incidence of retinal detachment when compared with patients without this family history.1,3â€“7 Further studies are needed to understand whether this association is causal and to identify possible molecular mechanisms linking genotype and retinal disease. One hypothesis for the cause is an increase in myopia associated with a dysregulation of the autoregulatory mechanisms of the visual cortex, the retina and the optic nerve.8 The effects of this dysregulation could be mediated by either a retinal tear or an intraocular obstruction with a hyper-permeability barrier, or the same mechanism could potentially affect the glaucoma by altering autoregulation in the retina or glaucoma and retinal tear. Our patient has a history of retinal tear, which was suspected to be related to glaucoma. A glaucoma biopsy had been performed in 1994, but a negative biopsy was obtained the next year. Although we considered a retinal tear the most probable cause, the abnormal vision and visual fields were reported to be associated with a diagnosis of myopia. The diagnosis of refractive error was made based on the refraction of the eye, which was thought to be correct. We also considered the possibility related to the retinal tear that the abnormality in the optic nerves was also involved. This would have increased the intraocular pressure and a retinal tear would have been necessary for a refractive change to be associated with vision loss. Alternatively, the ocular pathology could be related to a different mechanism, including a microanatomic abnormality in the visual cortex, a lesion at the level of the optic nerve and changes in the membrane or lipid content of the retinal layer.9 One study has been performed that suggests that abnormalities in the lipid content of the retinal layer could be involved in the pathophysiology of retinal detachments. The authors have demonstrated that in vitro, retinal lipid is highly oxidized in vivo.10 The level of lipid per unit area of the retinal layer within an area of the retina was found to be
