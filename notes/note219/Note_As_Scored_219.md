**PROMPT:**

Assessment: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

. It is his next course of treatment. He returns as normal at six weeks' follow-up but develops a fever in two weeks and is again a nonpersonality, noncompliance. He returns for three-day visits and during the third, he has a spontaneous bowel movement. The first is unremarkable. There is not an obvious cause for the bowel movement. The second visit, two weeks later, is the classic "rediscovery" of the colonic polyp and it is excised and placed in a bag.
