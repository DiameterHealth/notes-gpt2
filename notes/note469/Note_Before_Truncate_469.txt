The mother of the patient reported the following on the day of her prenatal visit (8/26/2015): " I will be in for my check-up at 17:00. The baby was born at 11:48 pm"  Patient's midwife states that the woman has a history of multiple pregnancies.  The patient has delivered twins at least four times.  The woman's PPD is normal. The woman's labor is progressing well. However, the woman is reporting discomfort in one of her thighs and that her abdomen is tender. The patient also reports that she has a pain in the right lower abdomen during labor due to a bowel block.  The midwife is concerned that the patient will experience increased bleeding and cramping if a delivery occurs during her visit.  The patient is having an amniotic fluid extraction today to collect fetal heart and brain matter for testing later this week.  The woman is a very conscientious person with a strong work ethic.  The patient has a 2-yr old daughter.  In discussing the mother's recent delivery with her, the woman reported that, despite delivery, her daughter was in good condition.   Prenatal Diagnosis   The patient's health history is currently being reviewed by her primary care physician.
