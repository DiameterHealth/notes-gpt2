PROMPT:

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  Seen and examined. Pain controlled. Tolerating diet. Feeling well. 

RESPONSE:

  Treatment Status Not known. Follow-Up Assessment Outcome Questionnaire Pain Relief Scale (Pain Questionnaire), and the Short‐Form General Health Survey.  6.9 Systemic (Health)  6.9.1 In-hospital  Patient-reported adverse events may comprise physical and psychological symptoms, self-reported symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities. Systemic medical symptoms were not significantly different between treatment groups.  6.9.2 Emergency department  Outcomes were not systematically recorded.  7. CONCLUSIONS  Conclusions. This review is restricted to the efficacy of NICE-AUTHORIC, a novel and safe non-invasive device for the non-invasive assessment of pain. Our results confirm its safety and effectiveness in reducing pain-related disability, pain intensity, anxiety and depression, and improved survival. These findings should increase the likelihood that healthcare professionals and patients may benefit from this innovative treatment for the non-invasive assessment of pain. An open trial is needed to better test the safety and effects of NICE‐AUTHORIC in a larger numbers of patient groups.
