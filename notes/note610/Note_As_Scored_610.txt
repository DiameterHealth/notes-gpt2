PROMPT:

Past Medical History Patient has concerns including Rash. Itchy rash started yesterday AM on face. Was red, faded, then more red and tender in afternoon. Took benadryl once yesterday with history of no new food or products

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

. It started on right elbow and left cheek (upper arm) around 7 AM today and then spread to other parts of face and chest including throat, mouth, and nose in 4-5 minutes. This is a more severe form of the Rash I get after long distance biking, climbing, traveling long-distance running, etc. It is caused by a viral infection from a virus in the saliva and mucus that gets passed on during long-distance biking, etc.
