PROMPT:

Past Medical History Patient has concerns including Rash. Itchy rash started yesterday AM on face. Was red, faded, then more red and tender in afternoon. Took benadryl once yesterday with history of no new food or products

RESPONSE:

 . It started on right elbow and left cheek (upper arm) around 7 AM today and then spread to other parts of face and chest including throat, mouth, and nose in 4-5 minutes. This is a more severe form of the Rash I get after long distance biking, climbing, traveling long-distance running, etc. It is caused by a viral infection from a virus in the saliva and mucus that gets passed on during long-distance biking, etc. I am taking 1 tablet daily. This is my fourth attack in eight months. Last time I was hospitalized the same day (after a few bouts, but no one could figure out what was wrong with me until that last episode). If you have the same symptoms, take 1 tablet daily. I have used antibiotics this time, and it seems to be working well. A few friends of mine who are cyclists are all taking it as well.
