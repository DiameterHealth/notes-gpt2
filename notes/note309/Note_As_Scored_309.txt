PROMPT:

Plan of Treatment:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

Diagnosis of both conditions is made by an evaluation of right joint structure and synovitis. A right Knee Replacement can be performed, but its short lifetime with the current techniques leads to its exclusion, which prevents a patient from recovering to their pre-injury level. Prognosis for both conditions is poor - a few weeks should be expected after repair. Prevention of hip implant failure: the best way to avoid a patient suffering hip implant failure is to educate them to the risks and advantages of replacement.
