**PROMPT:**

H&P EXAMINATION The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

**RESPONSE:**

  The patient states that he is able to sleep through the night, but still has a "puffy" face and difficulty breathing when he sleeps.  During sleep, the patient has a very noticeable and frequent "sneeze."  His sleep apnea is well controlled with continuous positive airway pressure and a CPAP machine.  The patient's sleep apnea is due, in part, to his diet in which he eats relatively high amounts of carbohydrates, but also has high protein, low fat diets, and low alcohol consumption. Dietary history and sleep apnea The patient had a relatively sedentary life until early childhood at which point his mother had a stroke resulting in total respiratory failure and a rapid loss of peripheral pulses.  As a result, the patient grew up in an environment which provided little oxygen to the brain.  As a result, the patient has a condition called severe, acquired CPAP-resistant GERD.  Due to GERD, the patient experiences a wide range of sleep patterns but rarely sleeps through the night.  This is due to the patient's lack of a CPAP machine, which has caused a "stiff neck."  He says that he feels "dead" at night due to his neck suffering from neck and shoulder pain.  As a result, the patient's daily life is restricted to spending time in the kitchen and sleeping at home.  He does not exercise, but only exercises with the assistance of a personal trainer or stationary bike.  Anatomy and Physiology of the Sleep Region The brainstem, in the neck and in the thorax, is primarily responsible for breathing, controlling breathing and heart rate and blood pressure, and regulating body temperature.  The brainstem is also a hub for several other body regions including the skin, kidneys, gut, spleen, and the intestines.  It is at this region that there is the greatest tension between the brainstem and the rest of the nervous system. The "motor control" functions necessary during both waking and sleeping are not controlled by the brainstem directly, but rather by the spinal cord.  These functions include the following:  The heart, lungs, blood, skin, gastrointestinal tract (small intestine or colon), blood circulation, muscles, coordination, speech, breathing, and respiration. During both waking and sleeping, the CNS sends signals to the motor neurons via the spinal cord that control breathing.  The CNS's
