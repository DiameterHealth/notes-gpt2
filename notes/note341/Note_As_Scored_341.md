**PROMPT:**

H&P EXAMINATION The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

The patient states that he is able to sleep through the night, but still has a "puffy" face and difficulty breathing when he sleeps. During sleep, the patient has a very noticeable and frequent "sneeze." Â His sleep apnea is well controlled with continuous positive airway pressure and a CPAP machine. The patient's sleep apnea is due, in part, to his diet in which he eats relatively high amounts of carbohydrates, but also has high protein, low fat diets, and low alcohol consumption.
