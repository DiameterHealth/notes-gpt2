**PROMPT:**

HPI The patient presents with a fever and shortness of breath associated with community acquired pneumonia

**RESPONSE:**

 . Chest radiograph is normal. He has fever, cough, and vomiting, and does not have chest X-ray changes consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His clinical course is complicated by severe hemoptysis that requires ventilator support. A CT scan is carried out. CT shows a small pneumothorax, bacteremia, and small pleural effusions. The patient develops respiratory failure and remains intubated. CT and chest radiography show progressive pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the OR. Her lung function is decreasing, and CT provides no evidence of pneumothorax. She dies of septic shock in the OR at 17 hours post-laboratory diagnosis of suspected pneumonia. The patient's lungs are in an abnormal position, with evidence of progressive pneumothorax. Her chest x-ray results were nonspecific with associated pleural effusions. The lungs are filled with bacteremia without significant pleural effusion.  The history is confused with the above case (Fig1) except for his cough and fever. He also presented with a diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia. This diagnosis should not be confused with pneumonia acquired by smoking, which is rare. No case of suspected community acquired pneumonia has been reported from the United States between 1992 and 2010.  Clinical features  There are few documented reports documenting the clinical features of community obtained pneumonia in North American health care facilities. The only one published in Europe found a patient with community acquired pneumonia on the sixth day of a 24-hour shift (3).  This patient died of septic shock, although a CT scan identified a pneumothorax which was not managed. The CT scan did not show a pneumothorax, but he still had a chest x-ray change, small pleural effusions, and a significant pneumothorax. The patient was intubated and left on mechanical ventilation. The CT scan revealed a bacteremia and a pleural effusion with fluid. In the CT scan, pleural effusion could be seen in this patient, but the patient was managed with mechanical ventilation. It must be noted that a number of patients with suspected pneumonia have pleura effusions as well as bacteremias, and therefore the clinical diagnosis is not clear. Furthermore, in the report by Noyes (3), a woman with suspected community acquired pneumonia was admitted to intensive care with pleuritic effusion, but a CT scan showed only a
