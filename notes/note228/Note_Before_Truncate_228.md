**PROMPT:**

Assessment: The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.

**RESPONSE:**

  The husband was on bed rest through day 3 with no recurrences of labor. The only major medical problem was a pregnancy complication.  Case 2: The patient showed up with a fever and her fetus was at 38 weeks' gestational age. A prenatal CT scan showed a 13.5 centimeter long lesion on the uterine wall in the position of the fetus's sacrum. The fetus was alive prior to delivery in utero. The uterus was in a 5-point oblique uterine dislocation (OUD), as was the fetus. The OUD allowed an intra-uterine descent. The patient was discharged in the afternoon of Jan 3rd after a spontaneous delivery. The fetus stayed in the uterus up to day 3 of life without further trauma.  Case 3: The patient was in her third trimester at 37 weeks'. She was seen by ultrasound. The results showed a 2 centimeters long malform, consistent with the above cases. The fetus was at 37 weeks' gestational age, in a cervical dilation that could have resulted in rupture of the uterine wall. The patient's pregnancy appeared normal, and the membranes were normal. The fetus remained in the uterus up to day 3, with no medical problem.  Conclusion: The literature is clear to all: PDA must be a recognized complication in the setting of obstetric stress. The incidence of this complication is estimated to be 6:1 for spontaneous vaginal births but can range between 11:1 in a highly obstetric setting to 1:100 in a low-risk setting. In a low-risk setting, 1 out of 30 births will have PA (including OUD, and other nonviability presentations). In a very high-risk setting, 1 out of 13 births will suffer PA.  The best course of treatment for severe PA is intraperitoneal amnestic therapy by a trained midwife or physician (see NICE guideline CPT code 83960).
