PROMPT:

AP:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

I am told she has a low chance of a re-hospitalization as she also has a pacemaker but she does have mild left lateral subdural hematoma and is in stable condition. The MRI is not available at this time. PANTHER: A 5-year-old patient with an aortic dissection and a mild hematoma has been stabilized on mechanical ventilation with a portable pump.
