 î‹¶150/100 mmHg, dyslipidemia, and renal insufficiency was initiated. The patient was discharged to home after 2 days of maintenance therapy with clopidogrel, aspirin, and lamotrigine for dyslipidemia.  Background:  Previous studies show that the risk of thrombotic and thrombotic nonfatal cardiovascular events associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs varies with the degree of initial hypertension, which may be increased by concurrent drug therapy or concomitant use of antiplatelets and antithrombotic agents.  Objective:  To assess the impact of the risk of bleeding with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy on the risk of thrombotic and thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients prescribed such medicine.  Design:  Case series.  Setting:  Outpatient settings.  Patients:  A 25-year-old (white) Asian man who presented with 1 year of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use, with a median duration of use of 4 months.  Interventions and Outcomes:  He was treated by standard NSAID therapy, followed by maintenance treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin at 150 mmHg and with clopidogrel after he had started lamotrigine at 150 and 200 mg, respectively. He reported that he had no further changes in blood pressure, lipids, lipoproteins, renal function, and/or renal insufficiency for at least 2 years prior to the start of the NSAID therapy.  Results:  During the observation period, he developed a 3-day history of a new heart pain, atrial fibrillation, or rhythm abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) at the onset of his 2nd week of NSAID therapy, followed by a week with no symptoms for a normal ECG, followed by a further ECG abnormality at the end of the 2nd week of treatment with NSAID. He started lamotrigine at 150 mg, which was replaced by clopidogrel after 2 days. He stopped taking lamotrigine and clopidogrel and kept the clopidogrel at 200 mg after 2 days and increased it to 250 mg in week 6 of the study. On day 4 of the 3-day EKG presentation, he developed chest pain with syncope and was
