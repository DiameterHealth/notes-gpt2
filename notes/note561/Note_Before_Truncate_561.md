**PROMPT:**

History of Present Illness The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

**RESPONSE:**

  During the previous several years, she suffered from occasional upper aerodigestive tract (UAT) attacks, which have decreased, but have recently increased dramatically.  Asymptomatic, the patient had undergone an episode of non-diluted aldosterone.  She had a chronic course of low-grade elevations of liver enzymes and has had three gastric bypasses. The primary treatment was the gastric acid suppressant NPO for 10 weeks.  NPO (N-Oxalate Propionate) is an artificial diet in which it is the main component, but the ratio of potassium is increased.  The most well-known formulation of NPO is NPO (N-Oxalate Propionate) from Sanofi Pasteur.  After NPO was removed from the market due to adverse reactions, the patient returned to medical school for a year.  After her return, the diet was allowed to lapse again and she went on to have a course of H2 blockers. This was also the setting in which the patient first learned about weight gain in a patient she was treating in her hospital diet group.  During the initial treatment (n=30) of H2 blockers, the patient had lost a minimum 1 kgs.  At 6 months, the patient had gained 2.4 kgs  (not significant). Over time, the symptoms of GERD and sleep apnea had resolved.   In the year following initial treatment with the H2 blockers the patient again had a few episodes of upper airway obstruction, but these were rapidly responded to with a nasopharyngeal airway, and the patient was no longer treated with H2 blockers. At this point, the patient was put on a hypoallergenic diet that consisted of vegetable protein, low fat dairy and low calorie fruit.  During one week her appetite increased from 800 - 1000 kcal.  During the second week of that diet the weight was gaining again at an expected rate.  The case is interesting in the fact that the patient suffered from no severe adverse events in the previous year, but has now been overweight for the past 11 years and is on an H2 blocker regime for 3 years and counting.    This is pretty remarkable and should be taken with a grain of salt.  I have met and spoken with several folks who are severely obese and still manage to gain weight as well.  There is evidence that suggests they're doing
