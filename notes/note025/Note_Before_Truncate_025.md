**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.

**RESPONSE:**

  Should the fever resolve or the patient not be able to stand, the patient should be able to rest comfortably.  Encephalopathy: Should the patient have neurological deficits the medical consultant should be contacted urgently.   Management:  The medical consultant should identify the source of these infections and advise the patient of the most appropriate course of action.   An encephalopathie is not a single entity, so it is important that the patient receive a thorough assessment from a medical consultant. When possible, the patient should be referred to a specialist neurology or medical neurology unit for further testing. In this situation, this assessment can be performed by a consultant neurologist or oncology nurse practitioner with additional expertise in neurology and/or infectious diseases.   What you can do:  Make sure that any blood tests are normal and that the patient is being adequately cared for by the medical team.  If the patient is not experiencing seizures, then seek medical advice and the seizure may cease.  If the patient is experiencing seizures, the doctors should consult their specialist. Please read our previous post for more information on encephalopathy.
