Other outcomes include changes in vital signs, pain as assessed by the investigator, and the investigator's subjective appraisal of the patient's pain.  Additional Outcomes/Measures: Laboratory studies to measure uropathy and the concentration of creatinine will be administered.  Primary Conclusion: The treatment was as expected.  Conclusion for Prospective Study: Patients did not benefit from the use of the combination antibiotic/loperamide vs placebo.  Discussion/Conclusion: The combination antibiotic/loperamide combination might need to be re-evaluated.  [+] Literature Cited  1. Hsieh DS, Xu J, Wang G, Wang V, Chu C, Lu D, Cheng Q, et al.
