**PROMPT:**

HPI This is a 72-year-old male with history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft

**RESPONSE:**

 , previous pericardial effusion or myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. Prior to surgery the patient had been hospitalized for a 3-month cardiac catheterization and a peripheral arterial catheterization. He had no evidence of ischemic heart disease. The cardiac catheterization has been done a few times, and showed no abnormality. The patient's blood pressure was 125/80 mm Hg and he had no signs of coronary artery narrowing. He was also prescribed clonidine 20 mg/day and atenolol 10mg and a pacer. The patient's resting systolic blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg and his coronary angiography showed sinus narrowing. After a 10 year history of atrial fibrillation, the patient has remained atrial fibrillar, albeit infrequent. At his 2 yr follow-up, his left anterior descending coronary artery (LADAC) was found to be enlarged; it had widened from a pre-ischemic diameter of 2.8 mm at pre-operative examination to 5.4 mm at discharge. The left ventricle pressure was 135/82 mm Hg and the left ventricular size was 3.6 cm, with a sinus tachycardia of 10 seconds, with right main wave length 15 seconds with diastolic pressure of 42 mm Hg and a pulse wave velocity of 1.14 +/- 0.05 mm/s. On ECG monitoring, the heart rate was 50/min, with sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a mean QRS complex of 2.8 seconds. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 59% (3.4 +/- 0.2 V/min). The left ventricular wall thickness was 4.1 mm and the left ventricular mass had increased 1.5 cm from pre-operative examination. The total cholesterol levels were 130 mg/dL (<7.7 mmol/L) and triglyceride level was 118 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L). A family history of atrial fibrillation was obtained and the left atrial nodal index decreased to 2.2. At the time of ECG monitoring, the patient had a resting blood pressure of 115/70 mm Hg with heart rate of 60/min; sinus tachycardia with a mean time period to onset of the first outflow rhythm of 17.5 +/- 1 ms (range 6 to 35 ms
