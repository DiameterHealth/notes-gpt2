Pertinent Clinical Presentation  The patient is a 78 year old female with a history of stroke and hypertension. She recently fell in her home and reports dizziness and lightheadness

**RESPONSE:**

 . The examination has revealed that the patient is unresponsive to any form of stimuli. Her neurological exam reveals that she is apneic in the supine position, with ipsilateral paresthesias. Her cardiac examination shows cardiac dysfunction in both the right and left heart and, more importantly, a large aortic effusion. The patient's vital signs are normal. A complete history of her injury and stroke is required to identify any predisposing pathologic processes and determine the most appropriate treatment of this patient. Discussion A recent study (Spencer & Ziebart, 1991) has linked cerebral cortical hypoperfusion with decreased cerebral blood flow. A single case report (Eshbach et al., 1990) described a woman who was found hyperresponsive with hyperpyrexia over the past 3 weeks. Her vital signs were normal. A positron emission tomography scan shows an effusion of 30 cm 2 in cerebral cortex, but no evidence of hypoperfusion. She had normal cerebral angiography with aortic stenosis, no cardiac abnormalities and no evidence of cerebral ischemia (Eshbach 1989). In another study involving an elderly non-pregnant female patient, there was hyperintense EEG activity on both sides of the lesion (Tilley et al., 1983). The study demonstrated that the patient remained hyperintense and had diffuse brainstem response (CBR) over a long distance of 6 weeks to external stimuli. The CBR was maximal on the left and then the effusion decreased in size and the patient demonstrated a decrease in CBR to left but not right. The patient was placed on corticosteroids and experienced complete regression of the CBR. The patient was discharged for medical and psychological reasons. There are no data supporting or refuting the efficacy of hypertonic drugs for symptomatic reduction of cerebral perfusion in this population. More research is required regarding the specific mechanisms which occur during stroke and to determine the optimal treatment for cerebral infarction. In recent years, the neuroprotective effect of acetylcholine has been demonstrated in animal models of stroke (Bartok et al., 1991). In a rodent study, infusion of acetylcholine into the lateral subcoupons of a stroke model increased survival of animals. While more research needs to be done to replicate these results in humans, it does raise the question if more therapeutic doses of acetylcholine could potentially be beneficial. However, it should be emphasized that acetylcholine has been
