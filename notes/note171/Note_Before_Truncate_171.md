**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Plan:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE:**

  All the tests described for the diagnosis are done within the first 24 hours of admission. All the tests show a significant degree of bilateral patellar dislocation and calcification of the synovial joint. The patient is transferred to orthopedic rehabilitation facility, where hip and patellar ligaments and their attachments are repaired, reattached to the femur, reconstructed, and the knee is immobilized again. After this recovery, the patient starts in physical therapy and begins physical rehabilitation training. The patient does not perform any sport activity and does not use any other leg.  Treatment:  The patient is started with a 3-month active rest and an increased therapy dose of hip arthroscopy as an outpatient, with ultrasound to determine the extent of joint damage and to assess the position of the femoral head. In case the femoral head is dislocated or calcified, hip arthroscopic procedure is scheduled.  Conclusions: The treatment of bilateral calcification and dislocation of the patella in the affected side of the patella was successfully performed with active immobilization of the affected knee, while at the same time a high rate of return of function was achieved.
