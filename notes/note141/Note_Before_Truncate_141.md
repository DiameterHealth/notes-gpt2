**RESPONSE:**

 ______________. I suggest a homeopathic oxygen set of three pills (one for each person). Please note that you shouldn't leave the house because you'll need to carry a heavy pack when returning.   __________.  The patient will be discharged from the hospital on ______________, with two weeks to go until the next round of therapy, or maybe more time for more serious medical problems (like my son's blood pressure problems) that I'll need to take care of beforehand."  What is it you are prescribing "in a bottle"?   Here you can find out which is the most effective approach. It should be prescribed for the same patients as you are treating. It should be administered every 3-4-6 hours. At the same time the blood pressure can be checked. I recommend these dosages for the following blood pressure:  Normal BP, 20/80 = 140/120  Moderate BP, 20/80 = 140/120.  Severe BP, 20/80 = 140/120.  I recommend these prescriptions with only one dose in one day!  Note: This is "prescription therapy", it is not recommended for those who are dehydrated, elderly, pregnant, or taking sedatives. If you are taking medications other than acetaminophen, try different dosages and combinations till you find the one that works for you, even if it's the same dose of medicine.  What does not hurt if you have acetaminophen but does help if you take it along with other medications?   Antihistamines (2mg, 3mg, 5mg) – this helps to reduce swelling (it's like putting your foot before a punch in the nose). Some people might experience tinnitus when they have taken it. If tinnitus is bothering you, you can try one more dose.  Antiinflammatories (3mg, 5mg) – the drug reduces inflammation in the blood vessels. There's a possibility that it might reduce the pain that is associated with arthritis. The drug may also slow down the healing process, but if this is to a degree that you need more frequent blood testing in 3-4 or 5-6 months, or if you are having difficulty with an inflammation or infection like MRSA, then you should check with your physician.  NSAIDS (50-100 mg) – NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) reduce inflammation when taken in high doses. The medication
