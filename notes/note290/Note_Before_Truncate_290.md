**PROMPT:**

AP:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE:**

  The surgeon then decides to operate using a short incision on the right side in an attempt to improve the functional anatomy. The incision is closed with sutures.  Figure 7: The long incision (arrows) is made as a result of the patient undergoing hip reversion surgery. Note the long bone tunnels resulting from the incision.  Mild to Moderate Peroneal Osteochondral Deformation  Anterior capsule syndrome results from a degenerative process on the posterior pole of the peroneal tendons in which the peroneal ligament (PL) and the patellar tendon have undergone significant failure causing periarticular and interarticular degeneration. The peroneal ligament is a common site of degenerative changes due to mechanical overload from repeated movement of the femur. In addition, the posterior capsule may progress into a peroneal tendinosis (Figure 8) which may or may not be involved as well depending on how the patient handles their trauma.  Figure 8: The anterior capsule (arrows) typically develops from a degenerative process on the posterior pole of the peroneal tendon.  The presence of acute peroneal tendon damage can be determined by radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. However, most patients who have anterior capsule syndrome have not had an acute peroneal tendon injury. When such a case is examined for the presence of peroneal tears, it is determined that the injury occurred at the time of an acute peroneal strain, typically after running or kicking. Because anterior capsule syndrome is non-displaced, it requires a short incision in an attempt to repair the proximal portion of the posterior capsule in an attempt to alleviate the pain and stress. If the anterior capsule is not found and repaired, it can occur as a result of osteochondritis dissecans, a degenerative process that causes bone loss to occur on the periosteum. This tends to cause the posterior capsule and adjacent muscles to become weak and painful.  Surgical Solution  Surgical intervention for anterior capsule syndrome is used to improve the functional anatomy and allow for a return to normal activities. After initial evaluation to minimize pain and improve the functional aspects, surgical management is undertaken to achieve adequate functional anatomy.  Treatment options to relieve anterior capsule syndrome include:  Anterior capsule banded splint and crutches  Restricted range of motion splint with reduced use of extension bands  Anterior capsule
