**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making (MDM): The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

. There has never been a time in history when a treatment plan for severe asthma was developed by this type of care group and the MDM group with complete accuracy. It was not always the case that a pulmonologist was available for followup with a person with this disease. In the past, lung function tests, a bronchoscopy, and CT or MRI were not routinely performed for adults with asthma.
