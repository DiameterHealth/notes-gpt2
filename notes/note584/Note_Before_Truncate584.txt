 ______________________________________ (1) The patients also reported that the treatment was more tolerable for them than a generic version of Oxycontin, as well as being less physically addictive. (2) A survey of 12.5 percent reported a decrease in pain from 6 to 3 hours and a decrease in nausea at 5 hours. (6) In summary, the current trial did not support these findings. (3) As noted earlier, an analgesic-like action of ibuprofen has been demonstrated with two-hour doses and has been demonstrated up to 60 mg/day in rats and mice (6). (4) While an opioid-like effect has not been demonstrated in humans in doses up to 60 mg/day in humans (6), ibuprofen has been associated with less-severe hypotension than opioids (7, 8, 9). (5) Although ibuprofen does not appear to reduce appetite of patients with chronic pain (10), there is no evidence of adverse effects on appetite. (6) In a study involving a patient with long-standing, severe pain, no weight gain occurred over the 6-month study. Similarly, no adverse effects were observed in one study that included patients with back pain and osteoarthritis (9). (7) In short, there is no evidence of any clinically important adverse effects from ibuprofen.  In summary, the new study by Bailenson et al.(6) is notable for its finding that patients can achieve pain relief from ibuprofen by taking the pain medication three to five times a day over the first few weeks of treatment. However, these patients reported significant changes in pain management that make the study less persuasive for the time being than the previous study.  A Potential Dose-Dependent Effect of Ibuprofen on Inflammation and Bone Mineral Density in Patients With Chronic Nonmalignant Pain and Dysfunction  One area in which the study does point to a new point of interest is pain modulation. The authors reported that patients taking ibuprofen had significantly better pain outcomes than those given placebo, particularly in those with chronic nonmalignant pain. The improvement was seen in multiple clinical domains (11). Moreover, patients taking ibuprofen tended to have reduced pain and better quality of life scores, and were still better able to perform simple activities of daily living (12).  A key clinical finding was a significant reduction in markers of inflammation in those taking ibuprofen. The authors suggest that this
