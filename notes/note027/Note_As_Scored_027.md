**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

He has also had significant weight loss and hyponatremia. The patient has not had an evaluation in the past 6 months. He denies overtreatment of medications. The evaluation of other patients with atrial fibrillation has been minimal, but the current patient does not fit the exclusionary criteria for arrhythmogenic atrial fibrillation. Discussion: Â  The presentation and history of the patient are quite bizarre.
