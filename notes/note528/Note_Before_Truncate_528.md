**PROMPT:**

SUBJECTIVE This is Medicare wellness visit. Patient reports with no complaints and is currently taking atorvastatin for lipid management and aspirin OTC daily

**RESPONSE:**

 .  Patient reported to be taking atorvastatin for lipid management. Patient reports having no complaints and taking atorvastatin for lipid management in the past 12 months.  OBJECTIVE to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab or fingolimod (oral, injectable, and vaginal) for patients with a primary vascular ischemia [MI.1] who have been taking an ischemic drug (eg, isoproterenol) in the past year; and patient reported adverse events (AEs) for patients with MI.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS Patients were eligible if they met eligibility criteria for the current AEs criteria to obtain a trial treatment; had 1 of 2 criteria: 1. a primary MI, 2. had taken either an adjunctive or placebo cardiovascular agent in an effort to prevent MI. Patients were stratified by the use of adjunctive cardiovascular agents and placebo in their treatment of MI. Adverse events were selected based on the definition in the protocol.  RESULTS A total of 16 patients in the 2 groups were randomized (Figure 1) and 11 patients (68%) did not meet the criteria for clinical trial eligibility. The randomization algorithm was stratified. A total of 9 patients (61%) did not meet either AEs criteria and did not participate. Of the 9 randomized patients, 9 received adalimumab and 2 were randomized to fingolimod, and 2 were randomized to oral drug only.  The mean age was 65 years (range, 37–88 years), and 60% were women. One patient had hypertension and 3 were taking diuretics. The mean baseline blood pressure was 118/73 mm Hg (range, 83–149 mm Hg). Seventeen patients (63.4%) experienced an AEs, and 10 patients (48.4%) reported AE-specific adverse events (AEs). There were 12 treatment-related AEs (AEs). The most common AEs were bleeding (n = 4), rash (n = 2), nausea (n = 1), and fatigue (n = 1). The most common safety-related AEs were dyspepsia (n = 2), anemia/leukopenia (n = 1), arthralgia/arthralgia (n = 1), and skin rash (n = 1). One patient stopped the study to discontinue a diuretic and a 2nd patient experienced a
