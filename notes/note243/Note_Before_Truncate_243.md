  If symptoms start to worsen, call 999 immediately. (The following information has been extracted from the National Health Service (NHS) guidance) The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE):  "Amphetamines are contraindicated in a child on the ventilator or who has a respiratory or cardiac condition. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) should not be used in children and should not be administered with amphetamines in elderly patients as studies have shown that the metabolism of these drugs affects the body's tolerance. The risk of potentially fatal blood thinning in the elderly is more likely to occur if acetaminophen is used in combination with a stimulant medicine. The risk of blood thinning is most likely to occur when a drug is used as a standalone medicine or taken together with an oral anticoagulant used for angina pectoris, although it may also occur in patients treated with long-term methotrexate (sold under the brand name Diltiazem) or at some risk of bleeding. In some situations, it is beneficial to increase the dose of the first drug given. If the patient has symptoms of the common cold or is experiencing sneezing (also known as watery mucous), then the child is probably allergic to the drug. If the symptoms continue, it may be appropriate to increase the dose of the drug, take it more frequently when you are awake, change the child's medicine, or remove the medication from the child's medicine table."  NICE recommends that children with sudden or severe fever or who are suffering from a respiratory or cardiac condition should not be administered amphetamines to treat these conditions.  The NICE guidance further states that "if your child has these symptoms and is being advised to take the stimulant medicine as an outpatient, consult your child's GP or local hospital specialist on the best treatment option".  Should you feel tempted to ask whether a child will benefit from an amphetamine drug given at a 'young age', then make sure to talk to a child-care health care professional first. For advice on what you should do if you suspect a child is being given a amphetamine and are unsure of its legal age you can contact the Local Authority Child Protection Unit via the NHS Direct website.
