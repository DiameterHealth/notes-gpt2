**PROMPT:**

History of Present Illness This is a 72-year-old male with history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft

**RESPONSE:**

  surgery, angioplasty at age 40, and history of multiple chest infections that occurred at the same time he began his steroid regimen. He had not experienced any additional chest symptoms or any further cardiovascular disease diagnosis within 5 years preceding his start of steroid therapy. He did not have heart disease. The diagnosis of cardiac disease is based on electrocardiography, echocardiography, laboratory assessment and imaging studies. The patient presents with a history of chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia with symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute chest congestion. The patient has extensive cardiomyopathy with multiple infarcts in his right heart and three cardiac valves affected (the mitral valve, popliteal valve, valvular valve). The patient also has cardiomyopathy affecting four left coronary arteries and aortic arch. He has coronary artery dissection of the left atrium, one diastole, one dilator, two mitral valves, and a bicuspid valve. These valves have not been repaired and thus remain closed. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) has two lesions in its anterior wall (one in the left ventricle and one in the right ventricle with no left wall lesion). The right side is otherwise unaffected. The patient is treated with the use of heparin (400 mg twice daily) and has a normal cardiac catheterization without any significant change in left heart function, although the left anterior descending artery is slightly dilated. Aortic arch dissection is the most significant finding in this case. The patient undergoes surgical repair of the left atrium, mitral valve, popliteal valve, valve atrium, valvular valve, mitral valve, popliteal valve, valve atrium, valvular valve, popliteal valve, mitral valve, popliteal valve, mitral valve, popliteal valve, mitral valve, and popliteal valve. The left ventricular outflow tract from the valve atrium into the mitral valve is isolated and the mitral valve is reconnected. On the right side, the right anterior descending artery is repaired. It was found that the mitral valve was defective, so it will be closed for 10-20 years while the patient is receiving the steroid therapy. The patient can resume steroid medication 5-7 weeks prior to surgery for prevention of heart valves rupture and left ventricular dissection. Treatment with the steroid is
