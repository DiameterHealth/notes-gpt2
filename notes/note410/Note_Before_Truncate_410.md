**RESPONSE:**

 . This past weekend was the same. On Wednesday at approximately 6 PM my right leg was swelling and red (with swelling and redness from prior night). Was admitted and was given dapsone. Then later at 9 PM my right back/left foot area was red. Went to ER at approximately 1 a.m. where they ordered a CT (from a local hospital). At 6 PM on Friday. A large lump was seen on right side of chest at L8-9. They suspected cancer. They also noticed a mass on my left ankle near the knee. This was sent to a local oncologist at Cedars. Surgery for both was performed at 7:25 PM on Friday, May 23rd. They removed the growth and 2 large lymph nodes behind my left eye. Surgery went well. Both of the oncologists thought it was benign, so I'm done with the chemo. As far as what causes cancer? No idea. It's not common, but I'm thankful it's not cancer.  How is it possible to be healthy with a lot of food in your stomach for 4 days in a row? My friend was diagnosed with colitis recently. I have it too & it seems to be related to food in the stomach. I used to say food in the stomach causes colitis. But then I found this to be true!  Does anybody know if there is some sort of vaccine for this type of cancer? And if not, are there any specific drugs that are known to work? Is there any other type of chemotherapy I should be considering?  What foods can you eat in an attempt to alleviate this problem? (If you don't have anything to eat, you're better off sleeping for a few weeks in case the cancer grows back. Or maybe not sleeping for several hours a day.)  How much do you have to eat? Because you've been eating the same foods for 4days in a row. And that seems to be the cause for this: you've been drinking too much water.  Hi - I'm going to be at this event at 6pm on Saturday and have a few questions: Is it normal that it took so long to figure out it is my tumour (rather than the surgery to remove it)?  Any ideas on treatment?  How often or how many meals do you eat per day?  It's hard to comprehend that you are sick. Can you describe what is normal and how are you feeling?  Thanks
