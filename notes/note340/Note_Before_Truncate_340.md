**PROMPT:**

H&P EXAMINATION The patient presents with a fever and shortness of breath associated with community acquired pneumonia

**RESPONSE:**

 . He has a history of recent visits to a private physician and a family physician without improvement in his symptoms. He is a healthy African-American male aged 40. He denies any underlying condition and does not smoke, drink, or use illicit drugs. There is no evidence of underlying cardiovascular disease. His blood pressure has recently risen and is 120/70 during the examination, which has been recorded using a mercury sphygmomanometer. He denies previous use of antihypertensive medication and has only been taking acetaminophen for headache. He denies past use of illicit drugs other than acetaminophen. The patient has a normal serum creatinine of 14.4 mg/dL, a normal body mass index (BMI) of 26.7, a regular menstrual cycle, a short, uneventful marriage, and no history of head injury. Physical findings include an intact bowel and clear umbilical cord and are unremarkable with no neurological deficits. Physical examination revealed a weight of 190 pounds (77 kg), a height of 5-7 feet, and a relatively well-developed, well-coordinated upper extremity with minimal tenderness or pain in the ankle, knee, and hip. He had mild to moderate hearing loss in his right ear and the distal radius is slightly displaced to the superior aspect of the arm. A skin biopsy of his heel with a heel drop of 12 mm demonstrates benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient was discharged from the emergency department with instructions to be seen within a week by a family physician. The patient was seen 1 week later with a history of local pain and tenderness in his hip area and a tender ankle pain. There were no further changes to his health. During treatment, the patient was prescribed low‐dose antibiotics but was not referred because of the potential adverse effect on his renal function. Because the patient has no known allergy or other contraindications to acetaminophen, he is currently taking this treatment for pain only. He is continuing to respond to benzodiazepines, but he is discontinuing his acetaminophen use. The patient also continues to be treated with vitamin B‐12, in addition to other B‐12‐containing supplements. He received a total of 12 500 mg of B‐12 during July and August 2002, and all six of these vitamin B‐12 doses have been completed. The patient has been taking these supplements without any significant change to his health. The patient has not been taking any medications that might increase risk of cardiovascular disease over the period
