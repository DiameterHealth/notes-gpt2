  associated with the pain. This is a low-level of pain. Tissue injury in muscles and ligaments. Tissue injury of the neck itself. This appears to primarily affect the cervical spine as there is no evidence that the pain is felt on the forehead.  Examination  In this examination, the primary findings are as follows:  Lying on the left lateral side with the patient's head to the right, the cervical spine is straight and in proper alignment. The intervertebral discs are present with no signs of trauma. There is no evidence of disc bulging or bulging into the lumbar spine. The lumbar disks remain straight with no evidence of disk degeneration. The patient feels no pain at the sacral levels of her spine or at her feet. When asked, the patient says she feels a pain at the upper back/hind spine with no further pain. This is the most common symptom of back pain reported by patients and a sign of a disc herniation or spinal root canal trauma. The sacral nerve roots are clearly visible as small white bumps in the sacral regions (lower rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, and coccygeus muscles). The sacral nerve roots appear to be atrophied. The patient reports she feels pain, or numbness, when her back is pressed against a bench or chair when walking up steps leading to a couch or chair when sitting. A palpable, but not large number of spinal nerves are visible. The nerves in the sacral regions cannot be directly seen. There are no abnormalities of the spine other than the vertebral discs.  In the spinal examination, there is no evidence of cervical glenohumeral joint hyperextension, flexion or extension of the vertebral bodies, or dislocation of the vertebral bodies beyond the cervical spine and pelvis. There is no evidence of ligamentous damage or bulging of the lumbar vertebrae. The cervical spine appears very healthy and the spines appear to be free of degenerative pathology.  The Lumbar spine is observed to be free of disc degeneration (1.0/3.0 or 3.9%). The vertebral bodies are at maximum flexion and extension but little deviation from this. The intervertebral disc is seen without any bulging or any sign of disc herniation. There are no findings in the lumbar spine other than the vertebral bodies. The vertebral discs
