  been diagnosed as having bipolar disorder and given antipsychotic agents in the past. In early 2004, the patient underwent a course of therapy with lithium. The patient's symptoms began to subside on cessation of the drug, and his mood returned to normal. At this point, the patient underwent another course of pharmacotherapy with lithium, this time including valproate. At this point, the patient's symptoms subsided, and he began to experience significant improvement in his depressive symptoms. As of the date of our investigation, the patient had an improved, stable mood and has yet to experience any psychotic side effects that are also common in manic and mixed episodes.  Migraine, Seasonal Affective Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder Migraine is a common disorder of headaches that afflicts over 10% of the population and is associated with a risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality. It can occur at any age, but tends to start with the elderly. A migraine is characterized by a specific constellation of physical, behavioral, and cognitive symptoms. One such form of headache is the so-called "myalgic encephalomyelitis" or "ME" [1] . Symptoms of bipolar disorder [2] can include major depression and mania, as well as severe periods of euphoria. These depressive symptoms occur more commonly in the euthymic or hypomanic stages of bipolar disorder. Although these symptoms may occur in patients who have previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and respond well to antidepressant medications, the majority of these patients do not respond. One hypothesis suggests that the neuroreceptors in bipolar patients are more vulnerable to the effects of antidepressants than in patients with depression. Therefore, medications like valproate [3] could potentially alter the vulnerability of neuroreceptors in bipolar patients and improve bipolar symptoms without interfering with depressive symptoms, which is consistent with the work by Giesecke [4] and others who have shown the efficacy of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in bipolar disorder. Interestingly, the patient had been taking antipsychotics as well as lithium, both of whom have been implicated as being associated with depressive symptoms. This patient was previously prescribed valproate, in addition to standard antidepressants prescribed to treat depression, but discontinued the drug before discontinuing lithium due to the risk of seizures in patients with epilepsy.  Misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder The diagnosis of bipolar disorder is based on the combination of symptoms that are associated with a manic episode, and the absence of those symptoms in the absence of manic
