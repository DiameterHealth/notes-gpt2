**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE:**

  The history is consistent with a pre-existing atrial fibrillation.  The patient should meet the diagnosis of PACE and undergo initial treatment including epinephrine.  If the patient is unable to follow the initial treatment, the patient should receive continuous beta-blocker therapy for at least 8 h while the patient continues to follow the original treatment.   Discussion:  The patient is a 48 y.o. with a pre-existing atrial fibrillation.  There have been more than a dozen reported episodes of a sudden atrial fibrillation (SF-A) occurring with an attack occurring after eating a late-night meal (e.g., fried chicken with baked potatoes or an apple).   Most (95%) SF-A are asymptomatic, and few (1%) require emergency chest transport.   Although it has been suggested that a SF-A can be self-induced (e.g., by eating hot soup), a recent prospective observational study demonstrated that the majority of spontaneous atrial fibrillation episodes occurring during sleep were preceded by a previous event (20).   Interestingly, the authors also noted that SF-F was the only cardiac rhythm without a known predisposition (a history of recurrent ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], acute ischemia, a prior diagnosis of ST-segment elevation MI, or acute MI).   The authors also noted that in the absence of known history of a heart attack or stroke, there was no indication for immediate medical evaluation.  Instead, there was a focus on the patient's physical appearance and the medical history, which may also explain their failure to recognize the signs and symptoms of the sudden cardiac arrest (SCAR).   In a separate study, the authors examined events that occurred during sleep-wake cycles from 2010 to 2012.   They evaluated patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for acute bypass graft operation or for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and noted that the incidence of SCAR was not significantly different from the incidence of all cardiac conditions recorded under different study groups (1.07%, 2.05%, 6.15%).   However, the authors noted that there were significant differences between study groups with regards to age, gender, race, the presence or absence of pre-existing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], and stroke.  The majority (72%) of the patients undergoing bypass surgery without SCAR had a prior diagnosis of STEMI
