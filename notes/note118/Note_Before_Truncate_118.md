**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

**RESPONSE:**

 ************************** Biopsy is usually a small biopsy taken in the outpatient area. Biopsy is the removal of tissue from a patient in order to diagnose a serious disease. At the University of Utah Cancer Center in Salt Lake City, biopsies can be obtained on patients who come for outpatient care to the center, at home by medical professional, or when needed in an inpatient setting. ************************** Biopsies are usually used to establish a diagnosis or to guide treatment and/or research. A biopsy is a sample of tissue or cells taken from the body and processed for further study or diagnosis. Biopsy can identify cancerous cells, malignant cell growths, the location of cancer, or other abnormalities in the body. Biopsy can also determine the type and function of a cancer, its progression and response to therapy, and its relationship to other diseases and cancers. Biopsy may be performed for other medical reasons, including to examine the body in order to prevent infection, to diagnose abnormalities in the tissues of the body, or to study the cellular processes of the body. Biopsy of tissue is a medical service performed by a doctor to take a sample of tissue from the body for further study or to diagnose a serious disease. Biopsies do not always come from a tumor. Tumors are typically biopsied after the cancer has gone through a round of treatment or surgery. If a tumour is not removed after treatment it can spread elsewhere in the body. Biopsy is a service provided by a doctor. Each physician performs the procedure, which is called a biopsy , individually or in a group. If the doctor chooses to do the biopsy, the process is more expensive than a simple CT scan. The doctor does the biopsy by passing the tissue piece through a tiny needle in order to remove it (see below), then removing the tissue piece in an outpatient or inpatient setting that can vary significantly depending on their clinical setting, the size of the tumor, and the size of the patient. If a biopsy is performed in an inpatient setting, the doctor will probably use a microscope so the pathologist can observe how the tissue is moving as they pull it out of the body. All of this is made much easier by an ultrasound or MRI machine.  When should I expect results? Biopsies are performed when it is thought that they may be useful to diagnose a disease. That said, these estimates of biopsy rates are only estimates and may not match your case or your own experience with
