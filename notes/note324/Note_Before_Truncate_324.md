 ------------ MISSIONARY WORK The object of my mission was accomplished. I have been in the service a short time and now have the happiness to be a free man. I believe the time will come when I shall go and see some of my friends in the old country and feel a great pride in giving them the glad tidings that they are alive, that I am among them, and that I am at home. I am a native of Texas and have been a citizen of the United States for forty years, but I have never seen a good chance of being in the Legislature while I am a citizen. I have not been successful in business and have had no opportunity to make a good showing. In politics they would treat me with kid gloves. I have thought of going over to the other side to see this country, but have not yet had a chance. I hope I shall have it soon. I am a loyal man and believe in the Constitution of the United States, and my opinion of the government has not varied one iota during the six years I have been here. I may be a bad citizen. I have no enemies to speak of in this city. I have a good many of my friends, some of them here, but I am not a man to be influenced with the opinion of those who are not my friends. I am afraid that this is not the place for me. I have heard that the law will place me in prison and that I shall probably be shot, but the law will not be violated. I am a man of integrity and have never made one false step in all my life. I wish to retire to my native state and go to California, so that if it should be required that I go to fight another battle it will not be because I am no longer a soldier, but because I am not a soldier yet. I am not afraid of death; I am not afraid of being shot from a distance, but for one man to take a shot at you is nothing. I wish to come over and live with my friends; and the first thing I cannot stand to do when I leave this city is to go through the streets or sit down on a bench on the sidewalk. I am a true American, but I am not a soldier. I wish to go home to my family and leave everything on the farm. I believe in my native State. I will be a free man once more. I know this country more than I know Texas, and I shall be a better citizen for my time here than I
