**PROMPT:**

SUBJECTIVE This is a follow-up visit from prior encounter for back pain. The patient is continuing physicial therapy and OTC medications to manage the pain

**RESPONSE:**

 . For the patient who is using a back pack, is it possible to reduce the pain? For the patient who is using a cervical pack, is it possible to maintain adequate cervical spinal manipulation during exercise and sport? How do these issues and others inform our recommendations on the best pack? Do we recommend a "durable" pack or "lightweight" pack? Are there other important questions to ask the patient about back pain? Is there a specific device or design that will help? How can the client use the back pack to ensure proper alignment and provide support for a full range of motion? We will review common factors leading to poor back pain management and suggest practical strategies to address them.  SUMMARY BACK BACK PAIN Management of the symptoms of non-specific low back pain is highly influenced by the patients' specific needs for treatment (5,7). This report gives clinicians the information needed to provide best treatment for every patient.  REFERENCES 1. Wacholder S, Klimas G, Zalay M, Grosse V, Büsser T et al.
