**PROMPT:**

History of Present Illness This patient present with symptoms of arthritis and joint pain. He has been taking ibuprofen daily but recently reports pain the morning which has intensified. 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

He has been seeing an ENT physician for the last 6 years who has failed to offer any treatment in this situation. Since beginning an off-label use of ibuprofen it has only worsened his symptoms. A recent exam by the attending ER medical provider found a mild acute inflammatory reaction in the joint. Since the inflammatory reactions are minor the chance of major harm to the joint is very small.
