**PROMPT:**

HPI This patient present with symptoms of arthritis and joint pain. He has been taking ibuprofen daily but recently reports pain the morning which has intensified. 

**RESPONSE:**

  This is because  after a few months on ibuprofen and not noticing any improvement.   Based on his previous pain and symptoms, he's prescribed  Advil for pain. As this patient had previously stopped taking Advil, he is not aware that they have changed their formulation, but still has the symptoms of arthritis. The most common side effects reported from Advil are diarrhea, headache, dizziness, nausea, and rash. You also get  headaches, irritability, and loss of appetite. Side effects are similar to  Ibuprofen and it is best to avoid this medication for prolonged periods of time and to get  Advil prescriptions only after getting a proper evaluation.  Advil is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Its main purpose is to relieve pain and to increase the sensation of well-being so it  reduces inflammation. But  this pain does not stop pain caused by other diseases or pain in  a  normal  manner . This drug has been around for over 30 years and is currently the most popular drug in the world. But  it's not only for pain relief, it is also used because of its sedative and anticoagulant properties. Also an antiinflammatory activity.  Advil was originally meant for children, so the usual dosages was not  too much for adults. But due to its sedative effects, the recommended daily dose for adults is 4 mg to 6 mg of Advil each day.  It is also a very strong drug, that causes the body to increase its production of natural painkillers like endorphins to balance the effects of the drug. This results in a feeling of euphoria after  taking Advil. Advil can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and sometimes seizures.  This drug has been associated  with kidney disfunction. Advil can  cause liver failure so it's advised to avoid  taking Advil on an empty stomach.  Advil  causes liver damage, which is more likely if it is taken with alcohol or  illicit drugs. You should  avoid taking Advil on a daily basis unless you know what you are doing. It can not be  taken in large amounts unless advised by your doctor and it can not be taken  during or after pregnancy. The risk for  Advil  to harm your baby is extremely small and only  possible if the baby is
