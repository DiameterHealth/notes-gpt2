**PROMPT:**

Assessment: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

.  Explanation: The clinician would expect a high threshold at which a pulmonary study by computed tomography should be performed and not need to wait for clinical progression. Discussion: An assessment of time for the onset of progression may be helpful in setting the threshold for initiating pulmonary function testing and thus may help in guiding diagnostic and treatment decisions. Conclusion: An initial assessment should consider clinical, radiologic, and diagnostic criteria, as well as the time course and frequency of progression.
