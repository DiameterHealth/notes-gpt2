**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

**RESPONSE:**

  (with the patient's permission).  Dosing: The patient is given 3 units of 1:1 CBD:THC in 100mg capsule (with a total CBD dose, including pre-treatment, of 1.9mg).  Expected Consequence: The patient's symptoms are decreased, with no psychoactive effects.  Comments: This regimen provides an excellent relief from pain, and the patient does not feel high or hallucinated.  Results: 3 months. The patient reports significant symptoms relief from their pain, with no psychoactive effects. However, the patient's anxiety is still somewhat high, even though their pain is much lessened. In addition, the patient is still interested in experimenting with CBD.  Conclusion: This regimen has been an excellent, long-term, safe, and convenient form of treatment for a number of patient's illnesses.  The only thing I don't like about this regimen (and I'm really not sure why) is that it leaves patients with a little bit of a hangover. In my experience, this could be the result of the capsule being too concentrated. It would be helpful for patients to dilute the capsules with more of their usual or alternate, non-THC-based, pain relievers, such as acetaminophen.  My patient did not take the capsules for two weeks. After this, the hangover was greatly diminished.  Comments: This regimen does seem to produce a good amount of pain relief. In my opinion, patients may find that it is difficult to take this in smaller dosage; for example, for one day, one half of a capsule, or a couple pills of CBD capsule would be a good amount for one day. Patients may also want to work with their doctors about a specific time limit for using this regimen and avoiding side effects.  It's worth noting that a few patients report that they experience a hangover with this regimen, but some others say that they've had no serious problems with hangovers. If someone's experiencing a hangover, they should increase the dosage (and perhaps add acetaminophen as an analgesic instead).  Another interesting note: this regimen could have some negative effects on patients in whom cannabis oil is the only treatment for pain. Patients should remember that they may have a reduced chance of relief with cannabis oil; however, their overall health could still be in spite of this.  Note that there are numerous other strains, and even types of plants to try that have been
