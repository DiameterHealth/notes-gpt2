Past Medical History Seen and examined. Pain controlled. Tolerating diet. Feeling well. 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

I did some research. Here is a list as I saw it with the information provided. My Current Mood - Calm, Positive, and optimistic. I was asked to be examined for a blood glucose or blood pressure test - they do not ask for that type of test. This had happened on two or three occasions. If I were seen and examined, they would determine if all of my current medications were working or not.
