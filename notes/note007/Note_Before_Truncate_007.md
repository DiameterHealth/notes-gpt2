**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Plan:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE:**

  Patient denies any other cardiac or pulmonary disease, but says he is having difficulty in climbing stairs and has had headaches lately, and a sudden change in weight.  He denies tobacco use.  Patient has an unusual BMI (22.5).  Echocardiography shows ventricular hypertrophy, as well as evidence of progressive atrial septal and ventricular arrhythmias leading up to the onset of his cardiac arrest.  The patient is then given a ventricular assist device (VAD).  Â Explanation is very simple, that the patient is not fit for VAD use and was likely using marijuana to induce or maintain hypertension.
