**PROMPT:**

Plan of Treatment:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

**RESPONSE:**

  Patient was also advised to limit physical exertion for one week until mass had decreased to normal. The patient was followed up during the three week period prior to surgery.  Surgery  Surgery was performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital on February 5, 2006 using a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and he had only two days of follow-up after surgery. The procedure was performed under general anesthetic by an anesthesiologist and a neurosurgical resident.  Discussion  Pregnancy and Pregnancy Loss  Pregnancy-related morbidity is common in women with early onset hypothyroidism. The most common problem is early pregnancy loss, usually at 20 weeks. These women present with the symptoms of pregnancy (abdominal or pelvic pain, malaise, fever, chills, and weight loss) and often have blood test results indicating T 4 levels significantly higher in the second half of pregnancy than during the first. T 3 levels continue to be normal, and the patient has normal cardiac function.  The risk of pregnancy loss in the absence of overt hyperthyroidism appears to be highest at 36 weeks of gestation. In our patient, the symptoms associated with pregnancy were present at 18 weeks of gestation.  In a review of studies involving thyroid replacement therapy in women with early pregnancies, the mean pregnancy loss was approximately 8.2%. This finding agrees well with the data that show the incidence of early pregnancy loss to be highest in hypothyroid women undergoing treatment with a thryoid. The use of thryoid therapy at a dose of 50 Î¼g/m2 seems to reduce the chance of early pregnancy loss by approximately 90% (Baldwin and Hulley, 1986).  Prostatotics and Low-dose T 3  Some women with early pregnancy loss require thryoid therapy. The use of low-dose T 3 (T 3 only) seems to make it more likely that the pregnancy will be completed before an effective thryoid therapy is discontinued. The use of low-dose T 3 has been shown to increase the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth in women with a history of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) or spontaneous abortion (SUI). One report of eight cases of women with T 3 only therapy reported on the use of T 3 only suggests that the use of low-dose T 3 significantly increases the risk of uterine perforation, preterm birth, and stillbirth. These women may benefit from the high-dose replacement therapy.
