**PROMPT:**

SUBJECTIVE 25 y/o F presents to the ED with R knee pain and bilateral ankle pain following a fall. Pt states she fell down x2 steps onto cement. States she twisted her ankles and R knee.

**RESPONSE:**

  Pt had a fracture of JCL. ED does x-rays of R knee. Pt states she had an episodic back pain throughout the previous year. CT, PET & MRI done. R knee is found to be fractured and in significant disrepair including significant soft tissue injury. ED states R knee fracture is non-contact, and it's possible this R knee could be a source of her pain. ED states the fracture is associated with a fracture of L7-L8 and if the L7/L8 fracture is not repaired the patient is at risk for further trauma or bone injuries to L3-6. In all likelihood this L7/L7 fracture will continue to progress and may require surgery. EOLPT 2/23. 3RD RMP 3F 5/12. EOLPT 3/23.  Pt states she had no previous knee injuries and falls only 1 to 2 times a year. ED asks about recent knee injury. Pt states she didn't think it was recent because she saw a doctor who said to think it was her first injury of the previous year (which it certainly wasn't). ED confirms fracture in JCL and states that this is a significant fracture and she is at high risk for a further traumatic event. She is then sent for MR imaging and PET. PPT: MR showed multiple soft tissue injuries including several areas of the R lateral collateral ligament which were not healed and are potentially osteogenic. Patient had a MR ankle scan and ED states this showed some additional soft tissue trauma with a peroneal and tibial effusion. PET shows high blood markers for the growth hormone FGF21 & TGF-21, but not for IGF-1 which was seen 5 months prior. ED states her bone growth is limited but she still needs a bone graft. ED states due to the bone graft this is unlikely to occur this year. She is given antibiotics and an enema. ED asks if she has any pain or swelling. Pt states she has pain and swelling in both of her hips. ED states she has the usual knee pain due to swelling or pain; it doesn't involve the R lateral lateral ligament. ED states that the bone graft is probably to prevent her from making a second trip to the ER. EOLPT 2/23.  F states she has been walking for 2 weeks but now can't because the pain is back. She is sent for MR imaging and PET. PPT: MR showed two areas of soft tissue trauma including one in
