**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE:**

  The patient responds favorably in response to systemic corticosteroids and other treatment modalities and is discharged home with appropriate rehabilitation.  Notes : 1) The patient is subsequently assessed for a bilateral femoral-femoral capsule (femoral femoral head) injury. This patient had a prior left femoral fracture resulting from a fall several years prior to presentation. 2) In this patient the left femoral head bone was found to be the origin of the intraoccipital bone fracture. This was a first report of a second femorectal (femoral head bone) fracture in this patient. 3) The patient is assessed for a second left femoral fracture (femoral head only), and appropriate treatment for both fractures is determined in this report. 4) Because femoral head fractures are uncommon in North American sports, these fractures were treated as a separate entity. These fractures are not associated with the presence of femoral neck fracture. 5) FEMORIAL FACED ACQUAINTANCE WITH ACUTAL DEFICIT IN ACETABOLIC LEFT HIP AND LATERAL LIMBTAL-FEMORAL CROSS JOINTS (LLFPC) In patients with fractures of both anteriormost and proximal femora with left hip abduction dysfunction, there is at least a 1 in 100 chance of having a femoral head fracture. FEMORIAL FACED ACQUAINTANCE WITH ACUTE STRAIN IN ACETABOLIC LEFT HIP AND LATERAL LIMBTAL-FEMORAL CROSS JOINTS (LLFPC) This patient is a 50-year-old Caucasian woman who received an anterior compartment syndrome fracture (6.0 - 6.5 cm long x 2.5 - 2.8 cm wide x 3.85 - 3.95 cm long) in her right hip. The patient had a history of previous back injuries. She was admitted to a hospital in a stable condition with a low level of consciousness. She had no residual limb pain. No physical examination was given to the patient, and she was discharged home with rehabilitation. The patient returned to the hospital in an agitated state and was immediately placed on a hospital bed (with a low level of consciousness; she was unable to communicate). Her blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg, and she was wearing a cervical collar. An intravenous line to administer amiodarone was placed. The patient was intubated (stabil
