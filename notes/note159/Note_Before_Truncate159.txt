PROMPT:

Assessment & Plan:  The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

RESPONSE:

  and there is no change. The patient is still unable to speak and will not be able to have food or water. It is difficult to know what stage the patient is at but there is no obvious improvement. The Patient is now scheduled for a CT Scan.   Routine Tests:  Acetaminophen: This patient's symptoms cleared after the administration of acetaminophen at a dose of 200 mg twice daily.  This patient's symptoms cleared after the administration of acetaminophen at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. Chest X-Ray: The patient has a large blood vessel in his chest due to his enlarged heart. The patient is sedated. CT of the chest shows an enlarged right ventricle with a large heart. The patient was treated immediately with a calcium channel blocker and is now able to take medications including aspirin and acetaminophen.   Discussion:  The patient had no symptoms of heart block during the preceding 3 or 4 days. On examination, the right ventricle showed a large ventricle with a large heart and no evidence of severe heart block or heart failure.   A large heart with a ventricle larger than the lungs and no obstruction appears clinically normal.  Causes:  Heart problems. A rare predisposition to abnormal heart rhythms can develop by genetic, congenital, surgical, or toxicologic causes.  A rare predisposition to abnormal heart rhythms can develop by genetic, congenital, surgical, or toxicologic causes. Congenital: Many infants are born with heart defects that cause defects in development. These infants will have at least one abnormally large heart. Heart defects are a genetic condition but genetic defects are often present before birth and are not seen before birth. The risk for heart disease increases with age and the severity of the disease, but this risk can be mitigated through preventive care.

Traumatic: Although the most common cause of heart defects is trauma or infection, other factors such as severe infections, severe heart transplantation, congenital heart defects, and heart damage from smoking may also contribute to these conditions.
