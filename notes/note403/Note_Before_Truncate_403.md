  a history of alcoholism, and also has a co-existing bipolar disorder. This has been clinically noted by both psychiatrists and nursing students. The patient was previously stabilized on stable pharmaceuticals. She has been treated for the past six months with the antidepressant imipramine. It was recommended at the time her illness began to take a short 6 months to a year to observe any improvement. It could be difficult to provide a timeline to show progression due to the patient having no history of alcoholism or bipolar disorder. The patient had recently stopped taking her antidepressants due to worsening symptoms and the need for additional medication. It has been difficult for the patient to continue in her on-going treatment with a prescription of medication. She is currently on one drug with moderate side effects while continuing therapy as directed by her physician. There are no reported contraindications or contraindications to the medication. It is recommended that the patient stop the medication as soon as the patient can tolerate the increased and/or long-lasting side effects. The current treatment plan for the patient has been an extended open-label (3-12 sessions) continuation of imipramine at 2mg t.i.d. The most recent visit was at the request of the patient's primary care physician who has asked the patient to review her medications. There has been no significant improvement with this medication. The patient has not received any prior or follow-up medications with possible interactions with her medication regimen. The Patient's Treatment This current medication is being followed through a continuation of the current medication on 12 weeks, with each 12 week cycle consisting of 3 weeks on medication followed by 3 weeks off medication. The duration is intended to continue for the remaining 12 weeks of the present illness and not a one-time cycle for any reason. The 12 weeks of therapy will be followed by an open-label continuation of imipramine with 5 weeks of medication followed by 5 weeks off medication. After this open-label continuation, another 7 weeks of medication will be added to the 12 weeks of continuation. The patient will then re-enter the hospital for follow-up. The open-label continuation of the medication may be discontinued once the patient is stable in the hospital. If the patient is unable to continue the current medication on 12 weeks of medication, another open label continuation of medication may be considered. It is the patient's intention to continue in this current medication plan with a prescription of 3 months of either imipramine or fluoxetine at a dose of 1mg/day. The
