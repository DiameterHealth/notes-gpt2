PROMPT:

Plan of Treatment:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

He continues to have severe pain with a large heart rate that is in a rhythm of T-waves and R-waves and cannot be managed on medication that has not been shown to affect the arrhythmia at all. He is considered at death's door due to lack of response to current treatment. Any advice given on the internet is based on his history and it is unlikely that he would have come in for care after seeking outside treatment.
