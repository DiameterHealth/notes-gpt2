**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

She has recently changed her diet from very spicy food to more refined food. After some testing, I find out my patient has a thyroid disorder, which requires me to make a T2c (thyrotoxicosis 2-c). She is also on Ciprofloxacin, because he is at high risk for thromboembolic events. I start her on 250 mL of Fosamax every 12 hr and then increase doses after 4 weeks, as she does not tolerate oral therapy well at all.
