**RESPONSE:**

 .  Cases have been reported in this period of time: June 2011, April 2013, November 2013.  Laboratory Criteria  The patient tested positive for streptococcal pharyngitis, and the clinical presentation was consistent with this type of infection. Patients were treated with ceftriaxone 100 Âµg/kg (for 6 days) and penicillin 100 g/day (for 4 days).  Case Summary  A 21-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with a temperature of 38.2oC and a cough. He had previously had a negative culture and was on his third day off antibiotics. He was treated with antibiotics, and 2 days later he developed a fever again, and was sent for chest radiologists. His temperatures were elevated to 41.3oC. He was treated with antibiotics, and he received penicillin 100 gram tablets. His temperature was 33.6oC, and he was treated with ceftriaxone 150 mg/kg and ticarcillin 100 ml/dose for 10 days. He was transferred to a ward 1 h after the last tablet was taken and returned to theatre 2.5 days later. His temperature was 32.3oC. His chest radiographs were normal (CXR of normal), and he was discharged with an antibiotic ointment and a nasogastric tube for 7 days.  Discussion  A strain of streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, can cause severe and often fatal infections. Many strains that cause hospital infections are resistant to the antibiotic ticarcillin (i.e. cefotaxime or azithromycin) or penicillin (ie. ceftriaxone or amoxicillin) and may be resistant to one or both of the following antibiotics: amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/clavulanate, or cefotaxime.  Introduction to the Present Problem The incidence of severe and potentially lethal hospital infections caused by strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae has risen over the last 2 decades, with a rise in resistant strains occurring at the same time (C. A. Heine, unpublished data, August 2017). Hospital infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae increased from 10 cases/1 000 000 population during 1980-84 to 1.2 cases/100 000 population in 1984-90 (C. A. Heine, unpublished data, May 2012).
