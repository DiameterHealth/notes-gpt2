  no history of cardiovascular disease or dementia. There was no history of seizures or other motor disability. The clinical features of the disease are consistent with that of chronic myasthenia gravis.  Management: Treatment of these patients will include both medication and lifestyle modifications. In all cases, a combination of anticholinergic agents will be sufficient to improve the symptoms of depression. Patients need to be monitored carefully, and their medical conditions must be carefully evaluated.  Nerve Net Reanimation Therapy (NSR)  This is the latest clinical development of NRI. Nerve Net Reanimation Treatment has been found to reduce the duration of symptoms of depression (3 months), improve quality of life, and significantly improve symptoms of fatigue. It is considered to have the potential to be a breakthrough therapy for certain chronic, non-organic brain disorders.  What is Nerve Net Reanimation Therapy?  Nerve Net Reanimation Therapy is basically a non-medicated therapy using electrodes placed on one of the nerves in the body (usually the brain stem). The electrodes stimulate the nerve and a procedure called nerve netting is performed. This procedure releases a chemical or electrical discharge that causes a slight electrical excitation of the nerve that is then stimulated to grow new nerve cells. These stimulation can last 2-5 weeks in most cases.  How is Nerve Net Reanimation Therapy Used?  Nerve Net Reanimation Therapy has been found to improve symptoms of depression and fatigue significantly, in most cases within 3 months. After that period, patients return to their pre-treatment status. (3 months)  Affects  Major Depressive Disorder  Cancellation of antidepressant drugs is not a cure, but Nerve Net Reanimation Treatment is used to reduce or eliminate the side effects of other drug therapies such as lithium and other psychotropic drugs.  Insomnia  Insomnia, often associated with depression, can be treated effectively by Nervine Net Reanimation Therapy. (5-7 weeks)  Fibromyalgia  It is sometimes difficult to differentiate Fibromyalgia from depression. Nervine Net Reanimization can help to differentiate those two conditions based on symptoms, which can be treated with Nerve Net Reanimation Therapy. (5-7 weeks, and typically a 3-8 weeks follow-up)  Gastrointestinal Disorders  Capsaicin can cause constipation. In some cases, caps
