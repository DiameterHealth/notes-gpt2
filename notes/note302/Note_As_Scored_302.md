**PROMPT:**

Plan of Treatment:  Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

If the bladder gets blocked, the bladder should be surgically repaired. A bladder pump to treat urinary symptoms may be prescribed to allow the bladder to regain its normal rhythm. You may need injections for this procedure. Diabetes: Follow your family doctor's advice about your treatment and diet whilst you are on these drugs. A blood glucose test may be done in the first 2 weeks of treatment and then monthly thereafter.
