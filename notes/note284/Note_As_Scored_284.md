**PROMPT:**

AP:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

(SJG: Â I'm so glad someone did that.) In the ER, this patient had a heart defect and aortic dissection. After an EKG, he was put on a statin (which was not an option for the rest of the hospital's patients). He was released 1-2 days later after the nurse found an EKG that showed aortic dissection. In the interim, the nurse had noticed the irregular heart rhythm from the patient's ECG, but had never been told it was fainting.
