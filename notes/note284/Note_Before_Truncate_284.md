**PROMPT:**

AP:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE:**

  (SJG:  I'm so glad someone did that.) In the ER, this patient had a heart defect and aortic dissection.  After an EKG, he was put on a statin (which was not an option for the rest of the hospital's patients).  He was released 1-2 days later after the nurse found an EKG that showed aortic dissection.   In the interim, the nurse had noticed the irregular heart rhythm from the patient's ECG, but had never been told it was fainting.  The next day, the patient was still in the hospital.  The next morning at 7:30, the patient's nurse called and he told her the patient had fainted. An ambulance had picked up the patient and the nurse called the ED.  The ED nurse was told the patient had fainted at the hospital.  She then informed the ED nurse that a new ECG showed no evidence of atrial flutter.  She then informed the resident doctor in charge that the patient's condition needed to be assessed.  The resident doctor also had never been told this was a possible sign for fainting and told the patient's nurse not to tell him about the ECG.  He then called the ED nurse and said something along the lines of "Why are you asking about a fainting attack?  I told you all I can do is assess." He also told the nurse that they would do everything they could to help the patient.  He wanted the EKG, they wanted the EKG.  The resident doctor was concerned the nurse was trying to "bait" them in his opinion, which made the ED nurse concerned about being evaluated (although she didn't express this to the ED manager).  At the ER, when the nurse asked if the patient was on medication (for his atrial fibrillation) the resident doctor told her that they would do all they could to help. The EKG showed that the patient had atrial flutter and this is what he told the nurse. The next day, 10:00 a.m. The resident doctor phoned and asked what the patient's ECG was.  The patient had an EKG of 112 BPM at 10:00 a.m. The resident doctor called the ED on 10:11 a.m. and told the ED nurse that
