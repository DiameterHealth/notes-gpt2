   The patient decided to continue the surgery and surgery was performed as scheduled.  Cephalosporin (Ce) 250 mg or 3.5 mg PO daily for 7 days  Adjunctive therapy:  Adjuvant therapy was started  The patients treated with Ce 400 mg PO once daily for 4 days.  The patients treated with Ce 250 mg PO once daily for 0.5 days.  The patients treated with ce 400 mg PO 3 times daily for 0.2 days  The patients treated with ce 250 mg PO 3 times daily for 0.1 days  The patients treated with ce 400 mg PO 3 times daily for 4 days  The patients treated with ce 250 mg PO once daily for 0.5 days  The patients treated with ce 400 mg PO once daily for 2 or 3 days  The patients treated with ce 400 mg PO once daily for 5 days  The patients treated with ce 400 mg PO 3 times daily for 8 days  The patients treated with ce 500 mg PO three times daily  The patients treated with ce 500 mg PO once daily for 16 days  Recurrence at 18 months  At 18 months, Cephalosporin 100 mg PO three times daily was continued for the patient  The following were adverse events  There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding adverse events [ ].  Discussion  Quetiapine (CeBX003) is the first, and so far, the only active monoamine oxidase inhibitor proven to improve depressive symptoms in depressed patients (Wickens et al., 2009).  The main feature of the study reported here, that I refer to as 'quetiapine' (i.e. CeBX003) is to reduce the number of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in the brain, the number and severity of withdrawal symptoms experienced by the patients, and also reduce their occurrence in the future.  Another interesting aspect of this study was the patient retention of 50% of the untreated patients who would have been likely to respond less than 50% to the treatment in a 'naturalistic' study, with a placebo in their treatment group (Wickens et al., 2009).  In a study of 31 patients with MDD who received quetiapine (CeBX003), all were found to be highly compliant, had no more relapses than those who were also receiving placebo
