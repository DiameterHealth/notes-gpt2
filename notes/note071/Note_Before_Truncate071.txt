PROMPT:

Assessment: 56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction

RESPONSE:

  and ST elevation myocardial infarction is considered, and is likely to deteriorate to acute myocardial ischaemia with or without aortic aneurysm.  Preliminary report: Pregnant woman  Clinical presentation: Strain of bryostatin analogue drug (1) that is highly active and, although a non-narcotic, is not orally active.  Evaluation: Patient was in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. No abnormalities were found and the patient was put on 7+3 induction. After induction, the patient developed an increase in left ventricular function. The patient had a blood sugar level above normal, but was not hypoglycaemic. She had no previous history of cardiovascular disease, was obese (kg/m2) and had hypertension.  Intervention: The infusion of bryostatin was stopped. The patient was observed until the increase in RVs returned. During the following days, the patient developed a complete resolution of the increase in left ventricular function. Her blood sugar was returned to normal.  Outcomes: The patient recovered fully and was discharged after 10 days. The patient's RVs returned to normal and, despite the presence of a left ventricular hypertrophy, had returned to a borderline degree of normal. The patient was discharged after a week and her blood pressure (BP) and glucose had returned to normal.  Conclusion: This case report indicates that the drug bryostatin (10-14 years in the UK) is an active vasculopathic agent that should be considered as part of the differential list along with other vasodilators to manage the myocardial infarctions which may result from a ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Further research will be required to establish a causal link between the bryostatin use and the recovery of the patient's RVs.
