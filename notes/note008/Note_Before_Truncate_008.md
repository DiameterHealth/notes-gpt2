**RESPONSE:**

   Management of Infection:  Repeat any antibiotics prescribed and continue with as close to the same dosage as needed until the infection has been completely destroyed.  Treatment:  Prophylaxis:  This patient should have access to a prophylactic.  Antibiotics:  This patient should continue to receive the appropriate dose of antibiotics for the appropriate period of time.  Prophylaxis:  This patient should be monitored for any signs of infection such as an increase in stools.  Management of E. coli Infection:  The patient should have access to a culture and should provide that culture to the clinician.  Treatment:  All antibiotic regimens should be continued with the patients current dose and taken as long as needed.  Treatment:  All patients with E. coli infections should follow the recommended precautions from the CDC.   Note: It is possible that the patient's previous treatment response for a different medical condition (such as an infectious illness) may influence the results of our screening. If the results are consistent with the previous treatment plan, this patient should follow that plan.  F.B.I. Guidelines for Pregnancy, Birth, and Postpartum:  C.F.R.C.P. guidelines for treatment for infection with a sexually transmitted disease will not be used to evaluate the risk of transmission in women who are pregnant.  Women who are at risk of infection but are not pregnant are considered to be:  • At risk of infection if they have a sexually transmitted disease, regardless of transmission risk; • Informed of the possibility of infection; • Not at risk of infection when in the postpartum period; • Not considered to be at risk of transmission to a fetus.  In addition to the treatment suggested for infection with a sexually transmitted disease, all women have a duty to prevent the transmission of infection to their intimate partners.  Treatment:  Prophylaxis:  These women should be provided with testing to confirm their STI infection. They should continue with treatment as prescribed.  Antibiotics:  These women should be provided with a series of 3 antibiotics for 4 weeks. If the initial antibiotic therapy is unsuccessful, the women should receive antibiotics for 4 extra weeks. If the initial antibiotic therapy is still not effective, the women should be treated with 2 additional antibiotics for 4 weeks. If the patients take antibiotics on a regular schedule, they will not require extra
