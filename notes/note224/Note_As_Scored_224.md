**PROMPT:**

Assessment: Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

(systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg) are required to achieve therapeutic targets; this patient is an example of the "healthy" patient from which we can learn from. A patient with "high risk" renal failure without hypertension and with chronic kidney disease is less clearly defined. A patient who has a positive family history of CVD with a family history of renal failure is also in that class.
