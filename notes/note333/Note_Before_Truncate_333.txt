PROMPT:

HISTORY & PHYSICAL Patient presents with cough and states he has flu like sx since Sunday, feels like he his progressivly getting better. This s is a well appearing male with non-productive cough, headache, chills, subjective fever, muscle aches and flu like symptoms

RESPONSE:

 .  DISCRIMINATION:  I work in a primary care practice with many female patients and male physicians as well as staff. There are usually two male physicians to every female. The staff can not recall ever seeing any females with sore throat with sore throat, flu like symptoms and cough.  CLINICAL FINDINGS:  Phenylephrine was not identified as a treatment in this patient. He is receiving oral antibiotics for possible bacterial bacteremia. Although he is very dehydrated, he is having the makings of a good day. He is now on oral rehydration; it is probably best not to have him undergo unnecessary IV infusion if he is already dehydrated.  CONCLUSIONS:  There are many reasons doctors have good luck with male patients as providers and there are a lot more reasons female patients struggle. Many doctors don't know about the male/female preference issues on primary care services in this country. Some people need more than one gender in their medical team, but most will not accept gender preference on primary care services.
