related to her neck. We found it in her back and noticed a thickening of her neck in front of her eyes. Her CT showed a large bulging disc on the right lower-left side of CT-dilated abdomen. At this time, she was given a course of phentolamine and lidocaine and was given a 2% lidocaine gel. Following the onset of numbness of the left side in the absence of symptoms, she was given a higher dose of lidocaine by gavage.
