RESPONSE:

  related to her neck. We found it in her back and noticed a thickening of her neck in front of her eyes. Her CT showed a large bulging disc on the right lower-left side of CT-dilated abdomen. At this time, she was given a course of phentolamine and lidocaine and was given a 2% lidocaine gel. Following the onset of numbness of the left side in the absence of symptoms, she was given a higher dose of lidocaine by gavage. She reported more severe numbness but was not more sedated by the lidocaine; so her medication was changed.  CONCLUSION This case shows that it can be difficult to predict whether any patient will have a complication due to lidocaine (Lido) exposure, so it is important that the clinician ask her regarding history of lidocaine use. However, the clinical implications of the patient's clinical history, her clinical examination, and the evidence in the chart do not support that she is at risk for lidocaine exposure. Therefore, she should not be admitted for lidocaine exposure.  Copyright Â© 2017 by the American College of Emergency Physicians.
