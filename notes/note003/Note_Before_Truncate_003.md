**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Plan:  The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist

**RESPONSE:**

  at the VA Medical Center every 18 months for routine and clinical measurements, including measurement of COPD exacerbation. The patient has been on oral and inhaled corticosteroids for the past 8 years for a severe exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The COPD results are stable with stable medication. He is an "A" smoker who has smoked for most of his adult life. He denies tobacco use and does not eat heavily, but reports a "trucker's diet" consisting mostly of beef and cabbage. He does not have hypertension or other cardiac or renal complications. He denies other serious medical conditions; however, his cholesterol, blood pressure, and thyroid are abnormally low. The patient has had no major adverse health problems for a long period of time. In our opinion, his cardiovascular status is favorable and no further follow-up is requested.  Summary: This patient does well with low doses of inhaled corticosteroids (10 mg every other night for 4 weeks and then gradually reduced to an average of 2.5 mg per week). He is otherwise healthy and has a healthy lifestyle including a high intake of meat, fish, and broccoli. The patient has no other known serious medical problems and denies tobacco use.  Conclusion: The diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation related to COPD can reliably be made by a physician using a comprehensive evaluation with laboratory workup, physical exam and clinical examination, and patient interviews. The most important aspect of the evaluation is the measurement of pulmonary function, as shown by lab tests. If the patient is found to have COPD he or she can be adequately treated with inhaled corticosteroids.
