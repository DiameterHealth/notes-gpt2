**RESPONSE:**

  for pain management and physical therapy.  Complications: There were no complications or adverse events.  Comment: This is the first report from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the National Cancer Institute, and the Vaccine & Related Biological Products Advisory Committee that includes an observation period of 8 weeks following vaccination of HIV seronegative participants receiving TDF/FTC-ZIKV. The observation included a large cohort of participants with no apparent complications reported to the committee and did not have a significant impact on overall analysis.  Future research should further evaluate both the efficacy of the treatment and the potential immunological effects of this vaccine, including whether a longer treatment course can be utilized. Finally, more long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess immunological effects. In the meantime, patients and health care personnel are urged to consult a physician if signs or symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, or abdominal symptoms persist or worsen despite medication or other therapy.
