**RESPONSE:**

  . He comes to us 2 days before his 26 th birthday and has never been to the emergency room before. We discuss taking acetylcysteine 3 times per day until he does urate and cough down blood (not shown on the chart, but is likely not needed to reach goal). This s not an ED case we are going to treat it as a respiratory infection that we know can be better brought under control by acetylcysteine and other medications. Sx at 2 days of age: Misdiagnosis or a false positive? Sx at age 3, age 2. This is a patient whose symptoms suggest a pulmonary infection of some kind. The mother reports the child had a fever and a cough the morning of Sunday, April 26th that developed into "wheezing fit" by the evening. He came to the Emergency Department at 3:00 pm for a cough, and as usual, presented for fevers. When the child was admitted, the mother stated that he was feeling fine, and was just being "a bit feverish" (he was in the 90s when she saw him). This may not actually have been true as the child was admitted because of a "fever fit", which is not a true indication for admission to the ED. Sx at age 2. I am writing here to point out something that may be worth noting in the history. At 5:00 am on Sunday morning, our patient was admitted for bronchitic aspiration of blood. It is possible for a patient to be admitted for this very non-contrasting reason at 2 years old. We have not been able to obtain an accurate history because the mother only recalls the fever. This child has a history of asthma and allergies but does not currently present with such symptoms. He also does not have labwork indicating he is otherwise healthy. In this case we should be suspicious that he presents with bronchitic aspiration of blood and that he has a very unusual presentation on Sunday morning. Is this an Sx at an older age? Should not an earlier presentation be considered? A more detailed history from the mother would be valuable here. Did the child have a history of asthma or allergies? No labwork indicates this and the child's mother believes that these are not necessary. The mother is not very knowledgeable regarding asthma and other allergies, so it is very difficult to tell from her story with certainty, but I don't doubt her. The child's blood cultures are normal, which may indicate that they are being overdiagn
