**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

. He comes to us 2 days before his 26 th birthday and has never been to the emergency room before. We discuss taking acetylcysteine 3 times per day until he does urate and cough down blood (not shown on the chart, but is likely not needed to reach goal). This s not an ED case we are going to treat it as a respiratory infection that we know can be better brought under control by acetylcysteine and other medications.
