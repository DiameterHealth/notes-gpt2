PROMPT:

Medical Decision Making: The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection

RESPONSE:

 . Pt was advised of a change in dressing every day; however, the ulcer did not worsen over the course of the study period.  Blood Testing: Pt was on blood thinning medications for ulcers. This study was stopped because of the increased bleeding potential that resulted from the use of medication that is known to be neurotoxic in some instances.
