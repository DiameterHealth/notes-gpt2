Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care

**RESPONSE:**

 . The patient was able to manage her allergies with these modalities.  Discussion:  This is another case of subacute systemic lupus erythematosus. With the use of noninvasive skin blood test and other testing with a positive reaction, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis could have been ruled out.  Top of Page  3. A 30â€“35-year-old woman was seen for a minor surgery after an episode of exacerbation of an abdominal pain. She had a history of having an erythematous discoloration of her hands on the fingers. An oral course of methotrexate yielded a significant reduction in symptoms. Three weeks later her symptoms were tolerable, but two weeks later symptoms worsened to such an extent that she was taken to the emergency department. Her serum lupus erythematosus serology tested negative. She was then seen in the dermatology department for a series of nonacute abscesses in her hands. There was significant debridement and healing, but then several weeks later, a new mass appeared. It was large, nonabscessous, and at 6 hours, was tender to palpation. At 16 hours and again 6 hours later, it was tender to palpation and had a distinct appearance. Laboratory and clinical examination in the emergency department confirmed a complete thrombosis in the peripheral blood. She was treated with methotrexate and aspirin for 6 hours and then with intravenous hydrocortisone for the remainder of life. Laboratory testing revealed a plasma glucose level of 13.6 mg/dL, a hemoglobin level of 13.8 g/dL, a serum creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 2.1 x 10 9 / mL. The patient had a history of multiple minor head traumas, but none since her pregnancy in 1993. At the time of this patient's presentation, she was taking oral antihistamines, cetuximab, and prednisone.  Discussion:  Lupus erythematosus (LA). This is another rare disorder where skin involvement, and not vascular involvement, has been more common. Clinically, the classic features of lupus erythematosus (LA) involve the skin of the face and scalp and are typically characterized by erythema migrans, rash, blisters, and fever. These features have been reported in
