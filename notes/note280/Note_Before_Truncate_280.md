**PROMPT:**

AP:  The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist

**RESPONSE:**

  . Patients with COPD can be more likely to develop other co-morbidities including, but not limited to, HIV, hepatitis, stroke, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and/or pericarditis. The clinical signs and findings associated with co-morbidity may be more prevalent among individuals with pre-existing lung disease. The co-morbidities may complicate diagnosis, surveillance, management, and treatment for COPD patients.  DIAGNOSIS:  Pre-operative testing is an important initial step to ensure you have a COPD diagnosis before the procedure . A careful history is important to assess the patient for risk factors for COPD .  Management:  It is important to ensure that individuals have an appropriate level of exercise and physical activity during the hospital stay. It is also best to provide adequate hydration and fluids throughout the hospital stay, with meals or snacks, during the surgery and follow-up visits. Some examples of proper hydration include, but are not limited to: water containing at least eight to 10% water; sports drinks; and intravenous fluids. The individual should consume these fluids only after the appropriate testing (e.g. Pulmonary Function Tests, chest radiographs, and urine toxicology) is confirmed by laboratory analysis. Other medications should also be avoided during the hospital stay, including medications that may cause significant constriction of the airways such as phenylephrine.  The patient should be monitored and evaluated during the hospital stay. The patient should be kept in a secure environment (e.g., in a hospital bed with no movement for at least two hours prior to, and immediately after, each surgical procedure), and is at risk of aspiration of gastric acid into the oral cavity, especially in obese patients. If the patient is obese, the patient should be monitored for adverse reactions. Patients undergoing gastric bypass operations or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy procedures should also be monitored frequently for pain, aspiration, and bowel-related symptoms. The patient should receive an antibiotic ointment during and immediately postoperatively.  Follow-up:  Patient management and follow-up procedures are important to monitor the patient's progress during the hospital stay and the post-surgical condition. The patient should be instructed on the steps to take to ensure the safety of the operation and follow-up visit. The patient should be advised if medications are being taken at the follow-up visit (e.g.: antihistamines, immunosupp
