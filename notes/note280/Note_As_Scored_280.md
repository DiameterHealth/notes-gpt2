**PROMPT:**

AP:  The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

. Patients with COPD can be more likely to develop other co-morbidities including, but not limited to, HIV, hepatitis, stroke, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and/or pericarditis. The clinical signs and findings associated with co-morbidity may be more prevalent among individuals with pre-existing lung disease. The co-morbidities may complicate diagnosis, surveillance, management, and treatment for COPD patients.
