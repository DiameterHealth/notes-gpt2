PROMPT:

SUBJECTIVE Patient has concerns including Rash. Itchy rash started yesterday AM on face. Was red, faded, then more red and tender in afternoon. Took benadryl once yesterday with history of no new food or products

RESPONSE:

 . No fever, had history of fevers in the past. Had taken corticosteroid to treat eczema symptoms. No rash or itching in past. Also has taken benadryl 3-4 times a week for 2 months as well as oral antibiotics to treat MRSA with no reaction. No history of allergy. No fever today. No rash or itching today nor yesterday. Had colds this week, only sore throat. Felt like being on bed for awhile but did not have the urge to leave the bed. Have been taking melatonin to be more energized, which has helped. Was told that I should treat myself at this stage in the infection and the rash might ease up.  2.) Bacterial Staph infection. I went thru the antibiotics once with no reaction. My throat is just a little bit sore. I tried taking the cream yesterday but I don't know if it was enough. The rash is just itching a bit. Was told it's probably just a staph infection though. So that's where the cream is coming in. Have had antibiotics in it before and it cleared up.  3.) Acne/pimple. Not sure exactly when, but this last week, been itching all day long. I took the salicylic acid in a different medication form yesterday and it wasn't enough for me. The rash still happens to happen a bit but hasn't been as bad this week. I had never used a topical salicylic acid before and I have done both Tylenol and the topical aspirin.  I'm really hoping my treatment plan starts working. I've taken antibiotics before and it worked, but it took a while for the symptoms to clear up.
