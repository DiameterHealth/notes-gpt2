**RESPONSE:**

 . The child is seen to be healthy. The physician takes a history and physical exam, and considers a vaccination for pertussis a non-emergency action. The physician gives the pertussis vaccine and recommends continuation of the tetanus booster for 6 months as a reminder. A nurse practitioner discusses the patient's history and concerns with the caregiver and the parent. The caregiver informs the parent that the physician will not vaccinate the child until the child completes a home visit with a medical assistant. A home-visit is considered by the clinician as a routine visit. The parent and the medical assistant discuss the family history of pertussis. A discussion regarding the child's history and a plan for the vaccine administration occurs. In addition, the nurse practitioner completes daily health report forms and notes pertussis outbreaks in the child's community.
