DISCUSSION Chlamydia trachomatis infection most often causes infection in the urethra, but may cause infection in other sexual sites. Infection with Chlamydia causes urethral discharge, which often contains yeast and other organisms, as well as vaginal bacterial infection, and can usually cause infertility in the patient.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN Chlamydia and Chlamydia trachomatis The urethra and rectum and the penis are the only other sites of infection caused by Chlamydia. The urethra contains an average of 100,000 yeast cells per millilitre of urine.2 In contrast, the rectum contains between 1000 and 20,000 yeast cells per millilitre.2,7,8,9,10 This is a substantially higher concentration of yeast than occurs in the urethra and rectum.3,10,11,12 The colon also has a high concentration of yeast.8,13 The urethras and rectum are the sites of greatest risk of infection; only
