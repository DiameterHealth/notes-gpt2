**PROMPT:**

Assessment: Follow-up in 3 months

**RESPONSE:**

 )  Clinical remission was seen in all participants. No patients were required to restart the medication or lose weight, which was a positive development for the study and is a step towards finding a treatment for weight-related diseases as well as preventing their occurrence in the first place.  The trial was also encouraging. Although patients lost 5% of the initial weight during the trial, their average BMI did not return to the pre-treatment level in any of the groups. And although the group of people who were given a maintenance dose of the medication reported significant weight loss in all 3 months, researchers found no evidence of a relapse after the end of the 12-month study period, which suggests that the weight-loss side effects from the drug are less likely to reoccur in later years.  Future plans in terms of potential therapies for obesity and related complications will be carefully monitored as the trial continues in the UK. The next stage of the study is expected to be released in 2019, and could also include a larger sample size with more accurate weight measurements and additional follow-up time to ensure that patients who regain weight regain it at a slower rate. In addition, the sample size needs to be increased to include patients with non-diabetic cardiovascular diseases; those with underlying kidney disease; and those for whom diabetes affects only one or two limbs.  Dr. Ramiro Marquez-Alfaro of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, US, and the study's coauthor, commented:  "We want to encourage the development of drugs that can provide a sustained weight-loss effect over time and that could help to prevent the occurrence of these potentially dangerous consequences of obesity."  The study has been funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) under a cooperative agreement number DK069490 to the University of North Carolina in the US and by the University's Clinical Trials Unit (US) and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in the US.
