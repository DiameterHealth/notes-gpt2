 /shortness of breath. The electrocardiograms were unremarkable (ACS, 100; SVT, 120). The history is very consistent with a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) with infarct size of 3 mm. The patient was admitted to the Neurocritical Care Unit and underwent a CT at a 30Â°C level. The result was a small infarct with a mean area of 6.2 mm2. The patient's blood pressure is normal.  SAH  SAH occurs in a proportion of patients and is of three types - non-arachnoidal, epidural and intrathoracic. A non-arachnoidal SAH is the simplest type, and is caused by a small, blood vessel penetrating the cerebral tissue. The most typical site of intrathoracic SAH is the spinal cord, because this is the most accessible site to a neurosurgeon and because it is the most common site of injury.  In an attempt to treat the infarct after an SAH, the patient usually undergoes a procedure called a stent insertion. This procedure involves the erection of a small, flexible stent, approximately 13 mm in diameter, into an intraventricular space between a vertebral artery and the vertebral artery. After the stent has been pushed upward into the intraventricular space, the artery is occluded. The stent then goes through the brain cavity for several days to several months, draining away the cerebral blood, but it maintains some pressure at the site of the stent. These stents vary in size from 40 mm to 200 mm.  A more aggressive SAH approach involves surgery with the patient lying on her back. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is performed under local anaesthetic. The patient is then placed on a stent board, with one end being inserted into the occluded artery, the other end being inserted into the blood vessel. One end is then turned to the subarachnoid space, in an attempt to create a small infarct that is repaired, often with an anterior approach. This is called an anterior cross-ventricular approach. The patient may then be placed on a bed in a supine position to permit the stent to be replaced every 30 days.  Occasionally a larger stent can be placed above the area of the infarct and then stented (
