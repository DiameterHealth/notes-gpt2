  in the month of March/April of the year 2013.  The patient is aged 6 years (5 years) and has a weight of 23.8 kg (13.8 kg) and height of 1.74 m (1.35 m)  On the basis of the history, the family is of a decent disposition and the child seems to be doing well.  On the basis of the clinical examination, the developmental status of the child is under normal. The physical examination of the child is satisfactory and there are no obvious signs of infection.  The family has had a regular checkup of the child and the child has started school in the third grade. The child has been following the vaccination procedure in school for the last two years. The child is very healthy, active and playful (1–2 hours per day).  The child is currently followed up every three months.

Meningococcal Disease Antigens in DTaP  2.4.2.1. The human papillomavirus vaccine contains 7 viral proteins, 5 of them are serotypes of the vaccine virus. They are as follows:  • 2.1–2.7 L1 viral proteins.  • 2.8–3.2 M1 viral proteins  • 3.3–3.9 M2 viral proteins  • 3.10–3.13 L3 viral proteins.  The vaccines contain two types of adjuvants, i.e. (a) adjuvant and (b) adjuvant. Adjuvant is a substance that promotes viral shedding; its exact role is not known.  Adjuvant was not used in the Meningococcal vaccine; 2.4.2.1.1. The adjuvant in DTaP is polysaccharide of oligosaccharides. It is known that it plays an important role in the shedding of viral proteins in the seroconversion process due to an enhanced viral replication. It is believed that polysaccharides enhance both the shedding and the uptake of virus by host cells.  The
