Laboratory tests, including glucose, lipids and liver function tests were negative. The patient underwent a physical examination, which revealed no evidence of recent infection. Laboratory tests for the patient included two glucose home testing strips and a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Blood sugar measurements were normal. A fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin and HgbA1c were determined; glucose and insulin were both 10.9 mmol/L (6.1 mg/dL) and 8.3 mg/dL (3.9 mg/dL, respectively). A glycated hemoglobin level in the normal range of 12.4%-14.5% (12.4-15.1% when corrected for age) was obtained.
