**PROMPT:**

Assessment: Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days

**RESPONSE:**

  for any worsening of her symptoms.  (A) Dental X-Rays  Possible: No change;  Signs: The patient's exam findings on dental X-rays demonstrated complete resorption of the teeth, with slight bony displacement and small areas of enamel loss.  Clinical Relevance: A severe form of bone loss can develop following a carotid artery dissection.  Clinical Context: The condition is most apparent following a carotid artery dissection, or CAD. As a result, the patient's dental exams are generally done by a nurse; it is rare for a dentist to evaluate the patient. There are few studies regarding the incidence of this condition, but approximately 50% of these patients' teeth are lost; it may be a difficult and painful experience for these patients to go to the dentist for proper treatment.  Recommendation: For patients with a severe bone loss, repeat dental exams at two-month intervals for a 3 month period. For patients with moderate loss, patients should receive preventive care, which includes regular dental check-ups and medications at home.  (B) Endoscopic Studies  Possible: Bone remains;  Signs: The patient has bone in the carotid area, but the bony margin remains intact, with bone fragments remaining within the soft tissue surrounding the bone with no visible soft tissue. Endoscopic examination revealed no evidence of the presence of a mass; no other masses could be found within the soft tissue of the vertebral body. As a result, the patient was treated with appropriate medications and therapy and has been placed on strict bedrest as per his recommendations.  Clinical Relevance: Bone in the carotid artery (CA) is frequently referred to as diffuse axonal bone disease (DABD) and is associated with various neuroinflammatory symptoms, specifically peripheral neuropathy and spastic paraparesis. The diagnosis of DABD requires the presence of carotid artery bone fragments, and in this patient the bony fragments were consistent with a carotid dissection.  (C) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  Possible: The patient has significant bone loss;  Signs: MRI is performed and revealed no significant bone loss at the carotid end of the vertebral body; however, the soft tissue that has decayed and thinned over the end of the bone is clearly palpable in the magnetic resonance imagery (MRI).
