PROMPT:

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  This is a 72-year-old male with history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft

RESPONSE:

  surgery, history of recent myocardial infarction and recent history of gastric bypass. The main focus of presentation is chest pain, which may be intermittent or severe. He denies any recent cardiac, neurological symptoms, respiratory or hepatic complaints, and has no current pain medication for chest pain. A diagnosis of coronary heart disease should always be considered when presenting to a hospital emergency department with chest pain. The patient's history is suggestive of right ventricular dysfunction (which is diagnosed with a echocardiogram).  Treatment Management is aimed at relieving chest pain and improving clinical signs as indicated. A chest tube should be inserted in patients who do not respond to immediate treatment and to prevent further arrhythmia. When chest pain persists, a second chest tube or a general anaesthetic should be tried. If chest pain does not resolve, an alternative therapy should be considered. For patients who require hospital treatment for chest pain, a number of options are available including cardiopulmonary bypass, percutaneous coronary intervention, intravenous contrast media, and intracoronary coronary thromboelastography. The patient's blood pressure should be managed by an appropriate angiography or electrocardiography, regardless of whether an electrothermal effect is present. A number of studies have highlighted the importance of chest pain in the management of acute coronary heart disease and in future patient selection. A randomized trial has shown that low and high intensity chest pain is associated with poorer outcome in patients with acute coronary heart disease, with high concentrations of anxiety and anxiety reduction associated with low intensity pain.46 A study reported by Jain et al. has confirmed the importance of chest pain, specifically of high magnitude, in patients with acute myocardial infarction and found that patients presenting with chest pain of high magnitude had longer hospital stay and required hospital admission more frequently.17  Diagnosis of Non-Q-Blocker Heart Failure In patients with non-Q-blocker heart failure, clinical features include chest pain, dyspnoea, and reduced LV ejection fraction. The clinical picture of non-Q-blocker heart failure can best be seen by echocardiography, where the Q wave elevation and QRS complex morphology are associated with left ventricular dysfunction. Cardiac biomarkers (amylase and creatine kinase) are also reduced in patients with non-Q-blocker heart failure. In general, patients with non-Q-blocker heart failure require intensive care treatment with continuous high-
