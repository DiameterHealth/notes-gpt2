**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making (MDM): The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

**RESPONSE:**

 . The patient is nervous. He has had a recent history of aggressive behavior and his behavior is escalating. The PCP, with a sigh, informs the patient that there won't be enough time to explain everything. He has to make a decision. If the patient tells the nurse immediately, it might be a case of "he went away." If the patient waits until later in the day, it may be "he is on his own at the moment." The patient says nothing, and when the nurse asks him what is the situation, he says, "I don't know what to do, it's just awful right now." The nurse has no answers for him; it's a case for a follow-up appointment.  The patient is slated for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks. The patient is nervous.
