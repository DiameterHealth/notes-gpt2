**PROMPT:**

HPI This patient present with symptoms of arthritis and joint pain. He has been taking ibuprofen daily but recently reports pain the morning which has intensified. 

**RESPONSE:**

  The pain has become so severe  that he cannot even move his hands, as if they are burning.  Is there something wrong and should I call the doctor or a clinic with alternative medicine?    1. The first step of the course of treatment for the patient with this complaint is to make a full physical examination.  The patient can be reassured that any pain in the joints could be due to osteoarthritis. The most common mechanism of action of the drug is to reduce pain.  2.  The next action to be undertaken is to administer oral ibuprofen to the patient  to reduce the pain. The use of ibuprofen for analgesia is supported by both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, ibuprofen has to be given with caution because of the possibility of inducing hyperalgesia in patients. The possibility of hyperalgesia could be mitigated by using the lowest possible concentration of ibuprofen to minimise the possible adverse impact of high dose of the drug, or by careful selection of the most effective dose for the different joints, particularly as the level of tolerance to analgesia varies.  3.  The next step is to assess the clinical picture in order to identify the precise site of pain, and to monitor the response to treatment. The treatment plan should then be modified accordingly. Care should be taken to make appropriate referral for surgical resection of any bone-bearing joints, particularly the hip. If further investigations are required the following should be noted:  There is a risk of worsening of the symptoms over time.  The joint is likely to be tender at the time the symptoms begin to appear  The pain may return during the following 12 months, but it may be more intense and less responsive to treatment.  The patient may be in pain at this stage but not able to distinguish pain from swelling.  If any
