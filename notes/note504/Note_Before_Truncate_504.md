However, it is not clear whether cimetidine is also useful if it is given with tramadol. There are no data on the use of tramadol in combination with cimetidine for nausea and vomiting. Although cimetidine is often prescribed in its entirety in combination with tramadol on its own, in the UK a dose of only 60 mg of cimetidine is used in combination with a tramadol dose of approximately 125 mg (0.1 mg/kg).  Do not mix drugs that are associated with drug interaction problems.  MAOIs  MIR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase Inhibitors)?  These agents are very sensitive to the presence of phenylethylamine
