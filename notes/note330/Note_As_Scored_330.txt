RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

recently. It's the fourth time this season. No other change in our medications or diet. Not sure if I'm imagining anything. I'm worried because my doctor will be reviewing my prescription, but I don't want to stress about that. I just don't like thinking of anything bad happening that you can't do anything about.
