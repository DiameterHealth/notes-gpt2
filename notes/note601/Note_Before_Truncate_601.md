**PROMPT:**

Past Medical History The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

**RESPONSE:**

  During his/her previous medical history the patient was diagnosed as having a history of myasthenia gravis; recurrent exacerbations of her disease and had undergone multiple rounds of steroid injections. In the initial consultation the patient had demonstrated a decreased sleep onset latency (in relation to previous hours of sleep onset) with an increase in the overall time of sleep onset in relation to her onset time.   Sleep onset latency in this instance was as low as 4-5 min in the morning and as high as 14 min in the early afternoon; and the total sleep time during each day was usually around 12-13 min.  The patient was given a prescription for a high dose of dexamethasone to treat her GERD, which was prescribed as 10 mg daily with the expectation that this dosage would have a measurable effect on the onset of sleep. A recent review of the therapeutic dose of dexamethasone has shown that this drug is not effective when dosed on an empty stomach and is also ineffective when administered with a meal.  The drug is prescribed for daytime exacerbations and therefore, the patient did not consume any foods or beverages during the initial consultation, and this was repeated during subsequent visits.   The patient was given a list of foods and beverages to avoid during daytime exacerbations.  The patient would only consume soft drinks at night.   The patient has no medical history or family history of sleep apnea.  Her last recorded sleep onset was 5 h prior to her arrival in our clinic. The patient was evaluated, and during the examination we detected a severe unilateral upper airway obstruction with an initial T-wave inversion at the base of the T-wave (T 1 - T 3 in Figure 2).  The patient had severe acute rhino-sinusitis with a mass in the lower lobe which showed eustachian tube distendages and was noted to have a mass of soft syrinx (Figure 2f). The patient was taken to our clinic for a complete sleep study for 6 h to establish that her acute rhino-sinusitis was causing her persistent rhinitis. After 5 h of sleep with complete wakefulness we started the dexamethasone at 10 mg/day and observed an improvement of the patient's rhinitis in the following days.
