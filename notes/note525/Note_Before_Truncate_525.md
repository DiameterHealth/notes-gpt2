**PROMPT:**

SUBJECTIVE The patient is a 78 year old female with a history of stroke and hypertension. She recently fell in her home and reports dizziness and lightheadness

**RESPONSE:**

  for some period of time prior to the fall. The patient has been receiving care for hypertension at her primary care office since she was 45 years old. Her history of stroke is documented and she was brought in to our center for evaluation after being observed by two emergency department physicians. Her history of stroke was not in contrast to the stroke-free time of the two physicians when the patient arrived at our center. Her left cerebral artery is 3.5 mm in size and is thrombotic with a history of hypertension. She has normal coronary artery calcium and is able to take high-dose aspirin with no significant side effects. Cardiac function examination showed minimal ventricular tachycardia, normal ECG, and no other abnormalities that could contribute to cerebral edema. She was admitted to the coronary care unit after 5 days in the hospital and on the patient's first day admitted to the vascular unit for further evaluation of cerebral edema. Her hemodynamic parameters had fallen in the hospital but, on admission, she continued to have a systolic blood pressure of 110/65 mm Hg and an electrocardiogram of 150/90. Electrocardiographic parameters remained at this lower level for several days after admission. She underwent a repeat electrocardiograph 6 days after admission at which her electrocardiogram was normal, as had her cardiac function. Although the patient reported severe fatigue, there were no other symptoms that could explain this, such as fever or nausea. All other vital signs were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging was normal and there was no evidence of cerebral ischemia in her brain. She did not experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She has no chronic illness. At this time there is no evidence of progressive brain ischemia. The patient was discharged on 1 day after admission as stable. She was taken off high-dose aspirin and continues to receive medication on an as-needed basis. We can safely manage this patient on high-dose aspirin, without discontinuation of high-dose aspirin.  The reason for the drop in stroke and hypertension scores was due to the use of high-dose aspirin, followed by the use of other medications to treat her hypertension. We should consider decreasing the amount of aspirin used to further reduce the risk of stroke. However, the overall mortality of the patient over her lifetime is high so that this reduction is unlikely to significantly reduce the likelihood of stroke.  A potential complication of the stroke is thromboembolic events. However, this is a rare complication.
