RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

for some period of time prior to the fall. The patient has been receiving care for hypertension at her primary care office since she was 45 years old. Her history of stroke is documented and she was brought in to our center for evaluation after being observed by two emergency department physicians. Her history of stroke was not in contrast to the stroke-free time of the two physicians when the patient arrived at our center.
