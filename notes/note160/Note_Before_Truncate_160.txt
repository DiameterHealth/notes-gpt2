PROMPT:

Assessment & Plan:  Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and 

RESPONSE:

  an electronic oxygen delivery device.  The home oxygen and the delivery device will be monitored to make sure they are being used correctly throughout the hospital visit.  We expect to receive an update in a couple days from him.  While he was in the hospital, we had his family present.  All of his questions and complaints were answered in our home visit.  He is getting along great once he is able to return home and we feel it is time to move forward.  The doctors expect no major progress and we will continue with physiotherapy and physical therapy through July.  However, we will begin to work on learning how to swim for the summer.  There are always new lessons to teach us and we can always use more experience. Our gratitude to you for giving us the opportunity to meet and talk to a hero and for supporting us in the fight to save his life.  This is a journey we won't forget and we will continue to move forward.   Our prayers and love are with you and your family!
