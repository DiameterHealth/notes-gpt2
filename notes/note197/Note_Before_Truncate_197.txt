PROMPT:

Assessment & Recommendation:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

RESPONSE:

   Procedure:    Hematology:  Blood was cultured at 25% (3-4x10(16) CD45) with BHIAA and FITC for 6 weeks followed by antigen withdrawal.  Tests:  Cox2 assayed for IgM to cow's testicle and a B cell count of 9,000/ÂµL.  Serology:    Routine Blood Samples:  B cell count 6x10(16) CD45.   Routine Biopsy:   Clinical Findings:   The patient had minimal swelling and no fever. He was non-obese, had no evidence of lymphadenopathy or thrombocytopenia, and had no evidence of tumor necrosis or other significant abnormalities in the pelvic bones. Other features were normal. The patient was discharged 3 days after the procedure.  Discussion:   Ampakines are an essential component of the immune system. They are essential for T cell development, the maintenance of T cell function, and the production and clearance of T cells. The main role of ampakines is to protect against pathogenic infections and to respond directly against infectious cells in the environment (1). For instance, ampakines are essential to the immunocompetence of T cells of T H 1 human and monkey. Thus the ampakines have been classified as cytokines (2). These cytokines are of importance in the immune system to maintain homeostasis, and the activation of the immune system against pathogens is a fundamental component of survival under epidemic conditions. For example, in an infectious disease, these cytokines are thought to be involved in the development of an adaptive immune response to the pathogen causing the disease.  The development of the immunogen (eg, a particular antigen, bacteria, virus) triggers the activation of the T cells. T cells then use an antigen-presenting and antibody-reactive system to bind and identify the antigen. T cells recognize the antigen and make antigen-specific antibodies depending on the specificity of the antigens, and produce a signal and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses toward the antigen present in the tissues. This system appears to be an important mechanism involved in the early response of the immune system to viral infection.  The initial immune response can occur within seconds, and the next response can begin as long as 10 minutes following the initial immunization.
