PROMPT:

SUBJECTIVE Patient is being seen today for her obstetrical visit. She is at 27w0d weeks gestation. Patient reports no complaints, no bleeding, no leaking, no contractions.

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

No blood transfusions were attempted and she was discharged home today with no further findings or complications. Patient does have some swelling of the lower abdomen area. TREATMENT 1) Administer blood and platelet transfusions. TREATMENT 2) Treat patient as any other patient. CONCLUSIONS Although this case illustrates the importance of thorough obstetrical examination and prompt management in the late third trimester, it does not show that the risk of hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage during the first trimester is any different than a normal second or third trimester.
