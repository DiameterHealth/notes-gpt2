**PROMPT:**

HISTORY & PHYSICAL The patient is a 57 y.o. male presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath

**RESPONSE:**

 . The chest symptoms were noted as being present only after a short cold (4 days). On examination he had no previous chest symptoms. He states that he suffers from asthma and has been taking a combination of Benadryl and Tylenol for 10 days. The cold symptoms were noted before the shortness of breath. He states that at the time of the onset of the chest symptoms the patient was standing, and has no history of lung diseases. On examination the patient did not have signs of severe respiratory insufficiency. The patient has a normal family history including a 2-yr history of normal hearing, a 2-yr history of normal eyesight, and normal sense of smell. The patient was admitted to the unit in respiratory distress.  DISCUSSION The present case is of a young male that started suffering from shortness of breath with chest pain and chest pain when the patient was in the midst of fever and chest pain for two days. It was noted that chest pain was also present when he started feeling the symptoms in the past with a mild fever. He was also admitted in respiratory distress. After admission, he was given a chest radiograph. The chest radiograph revealed increased bronchial diameter and bronchiolar wall thickening with a decrease in the number of normal bronchioles found. A pulmonary tomograph and an echocardiography were performed with no improvement or worsening of the chest pain symptoms. After a prolonged cold (1 y), the chest pain was not relieved by use of an antihypertensive medication. This case emphasizes the importance of observing chest pain complaints as a symptom of mild to moderate chronic lung disease, particularly bronchitis and other pulmonary problems. Further studies are required to be performed to determine the effect of using antihypertensives upon chest pain symptoms.
