**RESPONSE:**

 . A chest x-ray shows a large pulmonary embolism. Is he likely to need transplant and is there a chance the cancer returns.  A&E  Patient presents with fever, sore throat and headache, may have been a case of chikungunya. Is he likely to need transplant. Has he been sick recently?  I think not. He had a minor stroke 3 years ago and was in and out of hospital. So the fact that he is on steroids (he's on them for his heart, his chest and prostate), and has been taking this anti-coagulant to reduce his red blood cells (which is good to stop blood clots) isn't a reason to be suspicious. His CT scans were fine. Is there anything else we can look at?  What is the diagnosis?  He's on steroids and has had anticoagulants for years.  What are the next steps for him?  What was the cause of this? Is the anti-coagulant causing this problem?  Did he catch it from eating spicy food?  Did he have a reaction to the antibiotics? Why did he take them? Do they have any side effects?  Why is he at such great risk for thromboembolism as his heart is small?  Are there problems with his other organs that are causing the issues?  He was recently in a car crash. Has he had anything like this in the past? And what is his history of it?  In the last few weeks he's had more pain. Is he experiencing a heart attack or what?  What was the cause of his pain? Is it related to the clot?  What was the reaction of the anti-coagulants he was on for his chest and prostate?  Is he seeing a cardiologist? If so what are their recommendations.  Is the pain and swelling in his abdomen getting worse or has it improved?  Is he having any other symptoms (in or outside of hospital) like headaches, fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain?  Is it possible his clot came back from his kidneys or he was infected with bacteria from the bacteria on his skin or other organs?  What is his risk for any cancers and how likely is it? Is there anything he should be aware of?  The most common cancer in those age 85+ is lung
