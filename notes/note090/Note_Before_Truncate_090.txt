RESPONSE:

  at St Vincents and delivered a healthy baby girl at 7:30 am on Jan 4, 2008. The baby girl had a low birth weight of 1737 g, which is less than the ideal of 2,000 g. The infant presented with severe respiratory distress at birth, but a neonatal history was well documented. The patient and her baby were discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 2 hrs after birth. She had no follow-up care and remained in her home after discharge. After 2 1/3 weeks, a routine follow-up visit was initiated. A second appointment was scheduled 2 weeks later at her home. Because this is a repeat visit, the patient received a second assessment. The assessment included: (1) a complete blood count (CBC) (normal) was done in the NICU and the patient was given an additional blood pressure check (normal) at 1 week post delivery and a repeat CBC within a week of discharge; (2) a complete blood count (CBC) was performed the next day at a hospital laboratory, and the result showed that the CBC had been normal and the patient was given the all clear; (3) a pregnancy test was given as a routine follow-up test but with a negative result on the last 2 tests the patient was given the all clear; (4) a complete blood count (CBC) and biochemical profile was done (total white cell count: 20,690 ± 5,764, hemoglobin: 8.2 ± 3.0 g/dL, platelet count: 25.8 ± 2.1 × 109/L, red cell count: 12,071 ± 3,735, white cell count: 2,958 ± 4,904, and lymphocyte proliferation: 21 ± 2.5 × 106/ml, and liver enzymes: total bilirubin <3.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase <1.3 mg/dL, bilirubin 10 mg/dL, and aspartate aminotransferase <2.5 mg/dL). She was given a 1 hour intravenous antibiotic to eliminate her antibiotic sensitivity and then discharged home. She did not return for follow-up follow-ups until 6 mo later. The physician was concerned about the lack of improvement in the patient's infant's weight and that the girl showed obvious signs of infection during her first visit at St Vincents.
