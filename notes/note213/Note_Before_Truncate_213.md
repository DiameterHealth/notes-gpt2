  if possible in order to assess her prognosis. Assessment is for the purposes of determining appropriate course of action.  Recommended Regimen:   Oral Fluvoxamine 25mg/day  Alternative Regimen: Fluoxetine 10mg twice a day: 10 mg orally, followed by a 5-7 mg t-2 hour tablet in the morning and an additional 5-7 mg in the evening as directed. For patients on Fluoxetine, maintenance doses should be prescribed at the same rate as maintenance doses given when the 5-7 mg t-2 hour dose was given. A t-2 hour dosage of 250 mg is currently recommended.  Drugs for the Prevention and Treatment of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse   1. Antagonisms  a) Dopamine Transporter Receptor Inhibitor: (D2 Receptor Antagonist)  b) Aripiprazole: (Anxiolytic)  c) Clozapine: (Atypical Antipsychotic)  D3 Receptor Antagonist  Oral d3 receptors antagonists inhibit serotonin(5-HT)1A autoreceptors. Antagonism of 5-HT1A autoreceptors reduce the reuptake of L-tryptophan and dopamine.  Aripiprazole is an open-label, randomized, parallel group, dose-escalation trial of up to 25 mg/day of olanzapine in healthy subjects. Aripiprazole was found to be safe at doses up to 25 mg/day in this study. The main adverse effects were nausea (17%), vomiting (15%), asthenia (10%), insomnia (9%), and headache (6%). The treatment-emergent adverse effects include somnolence or dizziness (13%) and tardive dyskinesia, or uncontrollable movements during rest (10%). The major and only drug-related adverse effects were insomnia (11%) and headache (8%). At 50 mg/day, the overall incidence of AEs in the placebo group and the active treatment group were 7% and 4%, respectively.  In a 2-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, olanzapine hydrochloride 25 mg/day was compared with placebo in elderly alcoholics suffering from alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and compared to olanzapine 75 mg/day. The primary endpoint was the
