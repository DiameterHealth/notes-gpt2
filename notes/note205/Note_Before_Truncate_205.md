**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE:**

  She has normal electrocardiogram. Cardiologist:  "We've got a new cardiac rhythm. We're going to induce another rhythm. This is probably a pericardial effusion." (Pause) "Or worse." [Cardiologist to patient] "You didn't just pass out! This is a serious situation!"  [Cardiologist to patient] "If we don't make a fist and do chest compressions, it's a pericardial effusion or a ruptured aneurysm, you're going to die."  [Treatment of a patient with an aneurysm] "You're going to bleed profusely from your chest and lungs. This is going to cause you to stop breathing. If you can hear me, you're going to be dead before your heart stops beating." [Refer to this story:   A Case of Ascaragus ,  if you don't remember when you heard me say this, stop reading and go back to the movie.  I've never watched it so I can't go into more detail.] Here's how the physician's thought process (in the example above) plays out:  When a doctor says 'pericardial effusion', my first response is:  "You were just speaking about how your son's heart failed. That's never going to happen, right?" Of course it didn't.  What I mean is:  'pericardial effusion' doesn't mean 'your heart literally started 'perishing'.  What 'pericardial effusion' describes is something akin to 'tissue death'.  In the case of pericardial effusion the reason for its occurrence is:   1)  Pheochromocytoma (pericardial effusion) :  the most severe form of heart failure.   -  A pheochromocytoma is not a cardiac cause.  2)  Myocardial infarction (myocardial infarction is called heart attack in the US, myocardial infarction in the UK : this is used here by reference to a severe heart attack as opposed to a simple heart failure (myocardial infarction) ): here the heart failed in the same manner as pericardial effusion, but this time the heart muscle wasn't supplying the coronary arteries with blood, and thus, pericardial effusion.  If myocardial inf
