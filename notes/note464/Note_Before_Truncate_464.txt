PROMPT:

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  Seen and examined. Pain controlled. Tolerating diet. Feeling well. 

RESPONSE:

  Duration:  No longer treated.  This patient described having a mild seizure disorder,  which was underlying and was diagnosed as  paradoxical tics. The patient was under observation for 2-3 weeks.  After discontinuation of the medication the patient was diagnosed with  epilepticus and was treated.  Epilepsy is often treated with a seizure medication. Other medications include valproate, lamotrigine, clobazam, oxcarbazepine (Orapi), gabapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, risperidone, trazodone.  However, most of these medications have dangerous side-effects, and many patients are switched to a different medication after trying the first for too long. Trisperdal is a non-toxic treatment to control epilepsy and other behavioral conditions caused by the disorder  [8] Prophylactic treatment for tics in children with epilepsy was suggested to be safe. The evidence to support this conclusion is not sufficiently convincing. Clinical experience with children is scarce.  Fewer data on tics in adults exist. FDA does not recommend the use of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. [9] There do not seem to be any reports of tics in children treated with tricyclic antidepressants. There was a case report which suggested that propranolol might be a useful adjunct to seizure-related therapies. There is limited evidence suggesting tricyclic antidepressant use in patients with tics is beneficial.
