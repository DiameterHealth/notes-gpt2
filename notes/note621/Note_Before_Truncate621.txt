PROMPT:

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

RESPONSE:

  The patient is noted to have progressive enlargement of his or her left pulmonary artery and a history of frequent dyspnea during exercise.  There is no history of a history of pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension.  This patient is an asthmatic who uses several inhalants.  His breath sounds are labimminently short and rapid-paced and the rhythm is variable. He is aware that he has a mild to moderate cough.  He is asthmatic and is an occasional smoker, with a family history of asthma. Â  Summary In this patient, we have presented a case with both pulmonary hypertension and asthma which was associated with significant pulmonary artery stenosis. We have also discussed the role of respiratory sinus arrhythmias in the pathogenesis of PAS. In this patient, the underlying pathophysiology was asymptomatic and the resultant clinical presentation did not lend itself to further investigation.
