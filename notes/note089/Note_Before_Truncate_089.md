**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making (MDM): She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.

**RESPONSE:**

  Her neurological exam revealed an abnormal MRI and EEG. During hospital intake and admission, she developed a mild motor skill deficit. Her neurological exam was followed by serial neurological examinations with normal neurologic performance. She was discharged home with low-grade neurological symptoms (musculoskeletal, visual) after 5 days.  2. Acute Toxic Encephalopathy (ATEP): She developed a transient Torsades de Pointes and a postictal coma. Her neurological exam revealed a right temporal lobe contralateralized cortical lesion with significant damage to the left temporal cortex.  3. Unspecified Chronic Post-Concussive Syndrome (UCP): She developed a right temporal occipital headache lasting 8 hours and a left temporal occipital headache lasting 3 hours. Her neurological exam revealed a left temporal lobe contralateralized cortical lesion, consistent with UCP.  4. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): Her TBI was confirmed by neurological exam, which showed diffuse axonal injury with diffuse contralateral cortical injury.  5. Multiple Sclerosis: Her multiple sclerosis was confirmed by neurologic exam which was found to have relapsing-remitting ataxia. Her cognitive and functional impairment deteriorated markedly over time, primarily with motor skill.  6. Cerebellar Ataxia: Her cerebellar ataxia was clinically confirmed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and confirmed by laboratory tests.  7. Multiple Sclerosis: Her multiple sclerosis was confirmed by neurologic exam, which revealed relapsing-remitting ataxia.  8. Acrocephalopathy: Her EEG abnormalities were considered to be a consequence of acute and chronic toxic Encephalopathy, TBI, and multiple sclerosis.  *The patient received an MRI, PET scan, and EEG at post-acute care, and underwent MR scan at hospital admission.  Discussion:  Multiple cases of milder forms of post-acute TBI have been reported [11, 22]. The mechanisms of action of these brain diseases are not clear.  Other neurologic disorders often precede TBI such as stroke, chronic cerebrovascular disease (CCVD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). We previously described a patient with CCSVI, TDP-43, and TBI [23].  However, most patients with these brain diseases have milder forms of brain damage. This is why we suggest more careful attention to
