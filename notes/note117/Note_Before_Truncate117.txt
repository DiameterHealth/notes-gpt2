PROMPT:

Medical Decision Making: Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications

RESPONSE:

  until cardiac rehabilitation services are initiated. [Grade D]  Cardiac Rehabilitation Services: Continue on current medications, monitoring, or medical procedures until cardiac rehabilitative counseling services are initiated. [Grade D]  Elevated Blood Pressure: Evaluate patient's risk factors to determine appropriate medications or medical treatment. In general, elevated blood pressure should be considered in chronic heart failure due to its effect on hemodynamics, cardiovascular function, and quality of life. It may be important to treat hypertension to improve hemodynamic and/or cardiovascular function of chronic heart failure patients. [Grade D]  Euphonicity and Dyspnea: Evaluate patient's level of consciousness. Treat with an opioid antagonist or if pain and agitation are controlled with opioid agonist medications, manage further as indicated. [Grade D]  Fatigue: Patient may require supplemental oxygen to support quality of life. [Grade D]  Gastrointestinal Abdominal Syndrome (GAPS): Continue monitoring and monitoring and supportive measures for gastric bypass surgery or colon surgery for acute gastritis or diverticular disease. [Grade D]  Gastrointestinal Bleeding: If needed, assess and adjust oral nutritional therapy to control bleeding. Evaluate patient for anticoagulation and monitor for recurrence. [Grade D]  Hemorrhagic Shock: Monitor patient for signs of hemorrhagic shock and/or sepsis and administer appropriate management [Grade C]  Hypoxia: If hypovolemia or hypoglycemia is suspected, evaluate and treat underlying cardiovascular conditions. [Grade C]  Metabolic Acidosis: Reduce patient's daily sodium-to-potassium ratio to a safe level to manage potential acidosis. [Grade D]  Pulmonary Edema: Monitor patient for signs of pulmonary edema and adminstering supplemental oxygen if necessary to maintain adequate lung function and oxygenation. [Grade D]  Renal Tract Infections: Initiate intravenous fluid therapy in conjunction with antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids if renal failure is suspected. [Grade D]  Sinus Infections: Initiate IV antibiotic therapy in conjunction with intravenous fluid therapy to control common conditions such as bacterial sinusitis, sinusitis due to the development of pneumonia, and recurrent aphthous stomatitis. [Grade D]  Subcutaneous Hemorrhage: If hemorrhage and/or infection is suspected, discontinue hydrocortis
