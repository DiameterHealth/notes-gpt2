PROMPT:

AP:  Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and 

RESPONSE:

 _________ and will continue to be kept in the hospital ________. Pt will need constant supervision ________ of oxygen.  If the patient has been recently discharged from hospital with breathing difficulties they may be kept at home. A hospital visit will be required to ensure the patient is receiving the medications given within the hospital setting.  The home oxygen and monitor are for life sustaining purposes only. They are not meant to treat acute respiratory tract infection. Home oxygen is not as good as hospital oxygen at preventing secondary pneumonia. The monitor will not improve the ability of the patient to breathe deeply during the respiratory cycle, which is the key factor in treating respiratory tract or lung infections. It is used mainly to monitor the patient before they are discharged.  This is a new medical device for the nursing profession. It was only approved on 1/11/13. There has been only little training and education available as yet. It was not included in the list of devices and medications in the new nurse's handbook as part of their training and education.  "How to Know"  How can you tell if your patient has home oxygen when they stop using? It will be in the record as a medication used and a treatment plan for the patient will be drafted. It will be clear and written (to the nurse's comfort level) how to use this patient. It will be on the list of treatment plans to ensure there are no confusion in how the medication is used and monitored.  You will note that it looks as if the patient is using oxygen with a home oxygen mask that is attached. It will appear to the nurse that they are not using a respiratory mask. How can you know if they were breathing the home oxygen in their home, before their patient was released from the hospital? This is not a procedure for which hospitals have been trained in at all. It is still in the process of becoming a fully recognized part of nursing practice.  The hospital can not tell the nurse if they are in their home when they take the patient's home oxygen, nor would there be a way to distinguish it when compared to the mask in the hospital.
