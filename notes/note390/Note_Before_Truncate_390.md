**RESPONSE:**

 . Then started using a new formulation of K-Y toothpaste 3 times a day. Started using an antihistamine at 8 AM and again at 3 p.m. after that. Now it feels like I feel drugged. Took oral probiotics just to make me feel better. Took melatonin today. Took vitamin D at 10 AM and it was working like medicine. It is hard to stop using all of these medications without a pill, as I have a doctor's prescription."  "I am going through a very painful infection and I am concerned about the possibility that I could have an infection of the ear. My initial appointment with a doctor was at 10 a.m. on Aug. 12. I was given some medication to take for five days, which I thought I could tolerate. I was also given antibiotics last night and that seems to be working well. Yesterday, I was given some antifungal for this infection. In addition, I took Benadryl (two times). I felt great yesterday. I also took Melatonin (at 10 a.m.) and the Melatonin just helped me. My doctor called earlier that day to check that I was doing all of this and she seemed pleased with my attitude. She also talked about my medication, which is a lot and I feel sorry to say that it seems to be working. I think the best thing I can do for my health is stop these symptoms. However, the doctor said that I should probably stop taking the medications. I have to talk to my doctor, but I have to stop these medicines or I have to take them again."  "I am an 18 year old male. I have been told by my pediatrician that I have a viral infection, and that I should stop taking the medication (for the next month). I do not feel that I feel the same. I feel that it should be okay if I take the medication. I will keep on taking it for three months. I am worried about how I feel. I have never been sick before, so I am very concerned about the possibilities of an infection."  "I take Tylenol (Advil, Motrin) 10 minutes before bedtime. My ear does feel better but doesn't feel quite as good as it used to. I have been taking it on and off for about three years. In January, I took it for about one month; I have been taking it ever since. This infection has been causing me constant ear pain
