  is recommended. The patient is in good health based on recent history and current laboratory findings. The patient is taking two medications, methotrexate and hydroxocobalamin, and continues to take them at the recommended dose, and his doctor is satisfied he is taking them as prescribed. He has no history of thrombocytopenia or other bleeding disorders. His blood work includes a folate panel including low and normal levels for folic acid and vitamin B12. His renal function is normal and he has normal liver function. A blood sample is obtained and analyzed to rule out thrombocytopenia/hepatic aberrations and acute or systemic embolism. These results are negative. A hematocytologic evaluation includes a CBC, immunoglobulin (including IgG) EMA, and T-cell count, as well as an antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, and IgG antibody titer testing. No other blood or organ-specific antigen tests are obtained at this visit. On examination, the patient's vital signs are normal. Serum bilirubin and liver enzyme levels are as expected for a young, healthy individual, and his renal function is as follows: Urine total protein (TP) 2.2 mg/dL  Urine creatinine 1.4 mg/dL  Urine creatinine clearance 90 ml/minute for adults  Total body water 15.3 liters This patient has an HIV antiretroviral (ARV) regimen, with a sustained virological suppression period (SVR) lasting a minimum of 12 months, and therefore the immune system is generally not capable of producing antibodies in response to the virus. An HIV T cell test is performed on the patient to rule out an acquired disease and to determine the extent of viral load. The patient meets his HIV antibody titer level, results of which are as follows: Negative  Nonresponder  An estimated CD4 count of 0  An estimated CD4 count of 100â€“150 Not tested positive, results are consistent with an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition that is not present in the patient. A second HIV antibody titer is obtained on the same day and tested against the patient's initial serum sample using a two-strand transfer assay (STFA). The results are as follows: HIV (antibody)-negative  Nonresponder
