**PROMPT:**

Assessment: Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection

**RESPONSE:**

 .  Intervention: Estradiol 100 mg iv every 2 hours will be infused for the first 7 days.  Outcome: Recombinant HPV-16/18, genotype 2, low-risk HPV-16 and -18-associated disease. No progression.  Conclusion: Estradiol 100 mg every 2 hours will not be effective against acute UTI in women with previous high-grade precancerous lesions.  Key Points:  Low-grade carcinomas rarely progress and/or persist. Estradiol infusion is recommended given that HPV 16/18 is a very common cause of recurrent CIN. Estradiol infusion should not be considered treatment for pre-invasive cancer and is unlikely to be effective in treating the most advanced pre-invasive cervical cancer. Estradiol is not effective against recurrent HPV-16/18-associated precancer of the cervix.  Recommendation:  Evaluate cervical cancer precursors with HPV 16/18-associated serologic testing before starting high-dose estrogen infusion. Estradiol 100 mg can be delivered over a 7-day course for the treatment of acute UTI. Estradiol should not be initiated for any disease other than cervical cancer.  Introduction  Women with HPV-related precancerous lesions should be screened for a high-grade disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [cIN] of ≥0.7 mm or greater) and treated with treatment with high-dose estrogen for the appropriate duration before the onset or progression of disease.1  Estradiol is approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer.1 In the United States, the recommended dosing regimen is given in Table.2,3 The dosing regimen for women with a 2-year-plus history of cervical precancer (cIN ≥0.3 mm, excluding those with a new abnormal Pap smear at 2 years of age or greater) is given in Table 3.4 However, the safety of the treatment regimen for cervical precancer has been assessed in women whose Pap smear is abnormal because of HPV infection and those diagnosed before the onset or progression of disease.2 Although an estimated 75% of women with HPV-related precancer have received treatment, no high-quality research is available that provides reliable information on the long-term effectiveness of Estradiol in these women.  We did not perform an updated meta-analysis of the evidence for
