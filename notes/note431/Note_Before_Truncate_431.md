 _____________________________________________________________ 4/26/2014  This is an interesting note because the patient seems to have been feeling a lot better over the weekend. However, she appears to have had some problems with the symptoms. We talked last night and she felt more nauseated than normal and was very weak. Also had some issues with her breathing. I took her to the cardiologist and we plan to go to the emergency room. The doctor just took some xrays and sent her home. I am hoping she'll get better.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TEST: PICC line of blood tests are normal  PICC line of blood tests are normal 5/10/2014  Blood work done for lab work:   _____________________________________________________________  5/16/2014  My wife was experiencing symptoms yesterday.
