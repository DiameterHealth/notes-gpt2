RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

_____________________________________________________________ 4/26/2014  This is an interesting note because the patient seems to have been feeling a lot better over the weekend. However, she appears to have had some problems with the symptoms. We talked last night and she felt more nauseated than normal and was very weak. Also had some issues with her breathing. I took her to the cardiologist and we plan to go to the emergency room.
