 ing (CABG), and left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of less than 35% (LVH). His previous physician noted diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. He was a nonsmoker. He had been on a very low carbohydrate diet (2,800 kcal/day) for 8 months and was able to maintain his weight during that time. He was given a low carbohydrate diet to see if he gained more weight than expected. At the beginning of the study he weighed approximately 110 pounds and was able to eat a normal diet. However his energy (energy from protein, alcohol, and fat) intake significantly increased to 3,300 kcal/day. During the 8 months, his weight increased to 132 pounds. He was admitted and was on a high carbohydrate diet (3,500 kcal/day) for 8 months. The mean weight loss from baseline to study initiation was 12 pounds and he lost another 8 pounds after starting the low carbohydrate diet. He lost 30 pounds on the low carbohydrate diet and maintained the weight from that point forward. His VLH increased from 37% to 58% by study termination time. At study termination he was hospitalized for weight loss and diabetes complications. Follow up of him is shown in Table .

Moreover we found a significant improvement in vascular function, endot
