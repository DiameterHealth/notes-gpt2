He has a large hematocrit of 54%, blood sodium of 135 mEq/L, blood carbon dioxide of 10 mm Hg, and blood sugar of 102 mg/dL.  His chest radiograph shows a normal appearance with no rib fractures, an acute tear in a small area of the intervertebral foramen ovale, and multiple lacerations throughout the chest wall. He has no known history of cardiorespiratory disease, and no family history of any of the acute respiratory distress syndrome including CHF, severe asthma, or acute bronchitis.

His pulse is 100 over the minute, and his ventilatory threshold is 85 mmHg.  His skin pH and blood ammonia levels are 7.35-7.35 and 7.35, respectively, with a urine sodium level of 140.

An ECG shows a sinus rhythm with a ventricular repolarization, a tachycardia over 160 beats/min, a positive or negative potassium gradient, and QRS complexes with regular morphology with sinus bradycardia and an elevated threshold (and PR interval).  An angiogram of his chest shows a normal angiogram, and his rib fractures have healed.
