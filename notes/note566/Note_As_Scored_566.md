**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

which gradually gets worse Over the last few years there have been reports of patients experiencing allergic rhinitis which becomes severe and life-threatening, but the only thing I am aware of is a person who died because the disease was caught early. The most common side effects from antihistamines include itching, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, dry and itchy eyes, sneezing, wheezing, rhinitis and headache.
