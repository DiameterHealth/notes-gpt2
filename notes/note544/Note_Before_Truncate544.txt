PROMPT:

HPI Seen and examined. Pain controlled. Tolerating diet. Feeling well. 

RESPONSE:

  (Note:  "Tolerating" is an accurate way to describe his condition, and he still has problems with pain. I don't have a strong desire to push this, it's not a priority.  His mom has been a bit more vocal about trying to get him off of anti-inflammatory drugs. In terms of what else should I be doing, that's probably the question for every single family.  This isn't something I have a way to answer, nor can I find any good resources on  here  for more information on making that decision. It's sad he's gone, but I'll try. I really would like to be able to say if I feel it will be okay without medication, and I won't have to worry about the effects. But like I said, he's had his share of health issues.  This was a really helpful post to me. I was thinking a lot lately about what my parents might have done and how they went about their lives.  I also got a lot of really great suggestions about how to make the decision or care for myself with that information and I was thinking of putting it into a post of my own. You all are very thoughtful and open-minded people who are looking out for your kids and trying to provide guidance. You can help me a lot by following the suggestions. Thanks for the great tips.
