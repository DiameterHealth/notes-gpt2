**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE:**

  The patient has made no previous treatment or medications for this disorder and had a normal cardiac history to date.  However, the patient's risk of death has increased recently (7.3% vs. 5.1%.  He took anticoagulants, beta blocker, and vaso active agents for his hypertension at that time).  The cardiac output was normal (97% of baseline), he presented with a very severe case of myocardial ischemia with a left anterior descending block. Echocardiography revealed a ventricular myocardial wall thinning and an abnormal mitral regurgitation.    Cardiac catheterization showed a 1.0 cm wall thickness in the left brachial artery (with a 5-cm diameter) and a 20.5 cm wall thickness in the right atrium (with a 13.0 cm diameter). This is a case that may indicate that a patient with advanced heart failure may have a suboptimal response to standard drugs.    However, despite his advanced condition, the cardiac output was normal.  Cardiac catheterization showed a very large mitral valve complex (0.15 cm), which means he had a much larger myocardial infarction, thus requiring more aggressive treatment.    Unfortunately, for reasons to be determined, the patient died during the ECG.  The cause of death is not known and further research will be required.
