The patient has made no previous treatment or medications for this disorder and had a normal cardiac history to date. However, the patient's risk of death has increased recently (7.3% vs. 5.1%. He took anticoagulants, beta blocker, and vaso active agents for his hypertension at that time). The cardiac output was normal (97% of baseline), he presented with a very severe case of myocardial ischemia with a left anterior descending block.
