PROMPT:

AP:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.

RESPONSE:

  Her water breaking from the vagina on the 2:30 am feed.  JAM: 2:40am - I went for an IV in the OB with the patient in labor. The next feeding would be at 6:14am .  JAM: 7:00am - I took her in my arms again. This time I would be taking her on her last feeding, so her water would continue to break.  JAM: I had my hands in my pants pockets. The nurses called me and asked if I really was going to bring our baby home to hold him. I said sure.
