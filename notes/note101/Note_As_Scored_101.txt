PROMPT:

Medical Decision Making: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

. In the past the PCP would have sent him to a medical facility and the family would have to wait a month or two for a follow-up appointment. But now the PCP can send the patient directly back to the treating physician where he will see his family and be able to continue working in his current job. In cases that involve multiple physicians, the PCP should try for the best medical care possible for the patient.
