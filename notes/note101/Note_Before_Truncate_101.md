**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks

**RESPONSE:**

 . In the past the PCP would have sent him to a medical facility and the family would have to wait a month or two for a follow-up appointment. But now the PCP can send the patient directly back to the treating physician where he will see his family and be able to continue working in his current job. In cases that involve multiple physicians, the PCP should try for the best medical care possible for the patient.  Patient Favorable: The patient has a general health problem, with a normal weight, and no other significant medical conditions. There is some evidence of a family history of diabetes, so this should not be a problem. The doctor will not be able to do a complete blood panel test unless the patient agrees.  Complicating Factors:  Other Medical Causes: Many diabetes patients have a family history of autoimmune disease such as lupus. If the patient has such an inflammatory condition, he may be at risk for developing type I diabetes. It is difficult to tell whether the person is actually predisposed to diabetes after the onset of disease but it's the only way to decide whether the person can be safely treated.  Severe Trauma: If the patient was in an accident in which there is a bleeding component, he might also be at risk because of the increased risk of developing a blood glucose problem.  Chronic Heart Failure: If someone has a disease causing chronic heart failure, they are more likely to have a blood glucose problem because their health improves more slowly.  Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia is when the levels of the bloodstream glucose drop so low they are no longer detectable by the body even when a meal is taken. It is also called hypoglycemia without hypoglycemia.  Diuretic Use:  If this patient is taking diuretics for other conditions (such as liver failure) or to improve blood sugar control, the doctor may recommend a lower dose.  Some people use diuretics in an attempt to regulate their blood sugar levels. This technique is not as good as having a healthy diet and exercising, of course. That is why I have given you many tips on how to control your blood sugar. The best way to control blood sugar is to take a healthy diet:
