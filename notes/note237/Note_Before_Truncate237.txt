PROMPT:

Assessment: After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

RESPONSE:

 __________________________ _________________  Tumors in Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis or Eosinitis Ocularis  Tumors in these patients are often asymptomatic. Patients need careful clinical judgment as they proceed with biopsy to exclude tumors. If these patients are being treated, careful monitoring of tumor size and appearance is desirable. Patients with this condition need additional follow-up visits to evaluate progression or recurrence. __________________________ _________________  Tumors with Non-Eosinophilic Esophagitis or Eosinitis Ocularis  These tumors can be identified in the presence of Eosinophilic Esophagitis or Eosinitis Ocularis, but may be asymptomatic. Treatment options vary depending on tumor size. Rarely, these tumors can have an increased risk of the occurrence of eye abnormalities such as glaucoma. These tumors do not increase in size during treatment. __________________________ _________________  Eosinophilic Esophagitis or Eosinitis Ocularis  Management of eye tumors is directed primarily at the ocular surface (including eyelid, eyelid margin margins and eye lids) and intraocular structures. These tumors are mostly asymptomatic and are treated as described above for Eosinophilic Esophagitis or Eosinitis Ocularis. It is a condition to be diagnosed only by eye examination when associated with inflammation or chronic eye infection. __________________________  Eosinophilic Esophagitis or Eosinitis Ocularis  Symptoms:  1. Ocular inflammation, sometimes with conjunctival (eyelid) or corneal (eye lids) involvement at the time of the first symptoms.   2. Corneal inflammation and/or detachment at the time of the first symptoms, with redness and swelling at the site of detachment.   3. Local inflammation and/or detachment to other structures.   4. Corneal ulceration.   5. Eyelid swelling and ulceration.   6. Eyelid/lid crusting, or corneal ulceration.   7. Corneal scarring (or ulceration), with inflammation.   8. Eye lids, or corneal laceration.  Diagnosis:  1. Is
