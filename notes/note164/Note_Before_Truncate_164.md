  is indicated.  CPR is performed  at 1 day, with follow-up at 7 days and yearly thereafter.  Lipid profile, physical examination, blood pressure, glucose level and creatinine level are noted.  No change is seen in any parameters in the 12-18 year study period. Patient continues to have excellent renal function and is asymptomatic of the disease.  Dose titration to a maximum of 3.0 mg/kg/day (30 mg daily at 3-day intervals) has been attempted.  This does not eliminate the need for treatment with oral antidiabetics, though it has been noted to improve blood glucose as well as decrease his serum creatinine. Patient's hypertension is controlled well and he is seen annually for the required check-up.  Lipids are considered in the context of other risk factors.  Efficacy and Safety:  It was concluded that the patient met the primary outcome and, therefore, this was a successful study. Discussion:   It appears that the patient with CVD has a high risk of CV mortality and death due to his hypertension. He is asymptomatic; however, because his hyperglycemia will be a factor for this outcome. Furthermore, he has hypertension secondary to high triglycerides and LDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and therefore has a high risk of CV disease. A small proportion (5% in the general population) of people may die from this CV event but this outcome is more likely with increased hyperglycemia. It also appears that this adverse effect is dose dependent and may be best addressed through dose reduction of the antidiabetic medication. The patients blood pressure was high (140/100 mmHg), high triglycerides and low HDL-C were all observed and therefore the patient had a high risk of having an adverse event. Thus, all the other risk factors were taken into consideration because of the patient's CV status.  Recommendations: The patient's CVD status needs to be assessed as part of this case study. The risk factors for CVD and hypertension must be further evaluated. A target blood pressure of approximately 130/80 mmHg needs to be set for patients with CVD. In practice, the actual target BP of 125/85 mmHg is generally achieved in most instances. However, some may need a higher BP or a lower blood sugar level before reaching the target of 130/80 mmH
