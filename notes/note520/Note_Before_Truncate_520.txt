On January 16, 2009, I began my assignment as a Pediatric ICU Respiratory Infections (PIRI) Specialist. My primary duties as a PIRI Specialist were to: Diagnose respiratory infections, diagnose and treat respiratory distress syndrome including pneumonia if acute.  There are currently approximately 10,000 patients treated at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in the ER each year. If you're not a PIRI Specialist, I would strongly urge you to seek one in your practice and/or community. We will continue to educate our staff on our Respiratory Infections (PIRI) guidelines and on the importance of early diagnosis and adequate treatment to prevent the most severe complications such as death.
