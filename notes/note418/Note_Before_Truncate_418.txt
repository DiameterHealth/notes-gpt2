PROMPT:

HPI Comments The patient is a 57 y.o. male presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath

RESPONSE:

  in the morning. He has a history of myocardial infarction in his 30s and was receiving high dose aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen for 2 weeks prior to this illness. A chest x-ray shows an anterior left wall radiate compression on CT scan. The patient is on a stable dose tibiotraceridine for his acute chest pain. The patient is under observation and is on his way to the cardiac center.  A 42-year-old woman presents after a day of severe chest pain. Three hours after the onset of her worsening symptoms, she is unresponsive, her breathing has stopped (non-ventricular), her pulse is 160 BPM, she has an elevated pulmonary artery pressure (POA), and she has the most profound acidosis I have seen in 20 years of EMS-hospital cardiac arrest.  Two hours later she receives a cardiac catheterization and is given a total of 1g sodium lactate to induce an early hypotension. At this point, she is a fair candidate for defibrillation. She is placed in the ETCA, and her pulse is 140 BPM, her POA is 85 mmHg, she has an elevated pulse rate of 100 BPM, and her TSH is low, at 1.0. The patient is given 10mg potassium acetate to help stabilize her POA. At this point, the ECG is on the ST segment, and the BMP is on the F/S section.  A CT scan reveals severe right-sided right ventricular septal compression (SRVCC). It is well-controlled by antiplatelet agents, and the patient receives 10mg of aspirin.  A further CT scan shows an inferior wall collapse in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with LAD dilatation of 10 mmHg (Figure C).  An ECG is done, and it shows a sinus rhythm with slow-wave activity (SWA) (Figure D), with a post-ventricular T-wave that has no evidence of prolongation.  A second CT scan also shows an E-wave that is normal.  A third CT scan shows that the LAD is dilated to 1.9 cm and not narrowing (Figure 1B). However, it is still widening to an LAD width of 1.1 cm on aortic anastomosis (A) (Figure 3B).
