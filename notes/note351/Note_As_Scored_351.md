(s),  3.1 FAST VETERINARY ACTIVITY On day 21, after being treated with a a cough and cough syrup (Sedelar), I have a small fever and a small bump on my neck. This is about 4,000mg of ibuprofen and a 30oz tube of AstraZeneca cough and cold medicine. What's with the cough and cold medicine? A week before I was hospitalized, I've seen my doctor complaining about being a little dehydrated and having a little bit of heartburn.
