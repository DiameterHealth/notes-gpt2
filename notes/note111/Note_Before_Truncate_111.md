  physician. However, if she is going to be on OTC medications for other reasons, such as seasonal allergies, then it is advisable to schedule additional follow ups. In addition, her physician should make sure to schedule subsequent visits as appropriate, including if there are any other potential medical issues that might have been missed during the visit.  The Patient  Background: A 33-year-old female presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, and altered mental status, followed shortly by collapse. She had been on oxygen during her respiratory arrest. Blood gases were obtained during the course of treatment, and there were no abnormalities.  Management Plan: Oxygen is indicated for the shortness of breath. In addition, if she had no cardiac cause of her chest pain, and is otherwise in good general health, she can be placed on nitrous oxide inhaler. The nitrous oxide inhaler is effective in reducing breathing and the risk for adverse effects. The patient is scheduled to have her next follow-up evaluated with a cardiac evaluation and/or electrocardiograms.  Management of Patients with Tic  Tic disorder affects a large number of young people, often in the school or work setting. It may be triggered by many common activities. Patients are often treated with behavior therapies such as behavioral techniques, and pharmacotherapy.  Recommendations  Preventive interventions are necessary for the reduction of tic disorders among youth under 16 years of age for whom tic disorders seem to be primarily due to environmental influences.  Although we have a comprehensive program of behavioral interventions, in general, we still recommend that behavioral interventions should be limited to milder or more specific symptoms. Thus, in children aged 12 to 15 who are clinically likely to have significant tic disorder, we suggest that the child be administered an evaluation form for diagnosis, treatment plans, and follow-up visits; also, special attention be paid to possible neurological, psychiatric, and social factors that may influence the tic disorder development.  Special Considerations  Special considerations for the treatment of the child may be made based on the age of the child (1 to 3 years and then up), the number of hours of sleep a child needs each night, the level of severity of symptoms, and the extent to which the family's and patient's attitudes and level of tolerance have changed.  A specific treatment plan for the patient based on the severity of the symptoms and the severity of the
