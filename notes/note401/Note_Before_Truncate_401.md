**PROMPT:**

History of Present Illness The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

**RESPONSE:**

  Her history is consistent with those of a sleep apnea patient who also had severe GERD and other comorbidities.  She did not experience worsening of symptoms as with GERD. Her initial examination reveals a severe right ventricular hypertrophy (3.15).  Her ESR was low (14.9) and heart rate was 160, which suggests a normal heart rhythm.  This is also in direct opposition to the findings in the previous patient (ESR of 120). This is the typical finding when patients with right ventricular hypertrophy develop sleep apnea. The patient underwent a complete pulmonary function test with an ETT (a tool to identify and measure the level of the pulmonary vascular oxygen extraction system (PVOA) in the chest).  The ETT revealed no evidence of pulmonary compromise.  However, the patient's ESR was still below 100, which is indicative of impaired pulmonary function.  The patient was seen by the sleep medicine specialist who determined that she had mild sleep apnea with no significant heart or LV dysfunction.  Although her pulmonary function tests are normal, her PEEP was over 60 lpm.  This is a reasonable pulmonary pressure, consistent with sleep apnea, but significantly higher than that found in other patients with sleep apnea. The sleep medicine specialist decided to initiate a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Her PEEP was lowered to 40 lpm and her ESR was reduced to 120.  Her VAS was over 20 and the RAS, also known as the respiratory rate, was normal.  Her heart rate dropped to 56 beats per minute.  Since both pulmonary function tests were normalized, her physician would consider her case to indicate an excellent response. After 4 weeks of CPAP therapy, the patient's pulmonary function and VAS returned to normal.  Her heart rate still remained slightly elevated, however, the RAS dropped down to 60 beats per minute which is a sign of improvement.  Her ESR remained normal, and her sleep apnea status was no longer present (although her ESR remained very similar to that of the previous patient who had no identifiable sleep apnea). Summary: A patient who developed sleep apnea due to an autoimmune condition that was resolved within 4 weeks with CPAP therapy.   A patient who was treated with CPAP and was also treated and diagnosed as having sleep apnea. The physician considered the evidence for the diagnosis of autoimmune type 1 diabetes
