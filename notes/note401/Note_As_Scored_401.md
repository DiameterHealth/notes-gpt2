**PROMPT:**

History of Present Illness The patient presents with allergic rhinitis and a history of GERD and concerns about sleep apnea. 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

Her history is consistent with those of a sleep apnea patient who also had severe GERD and other comorbidities. She did not experience worsening of symptoms as with GERD. Her initial examination reveals a severe right ventricular hypertrophy (3.15). Her ESR was low (14.9) and heart rate was 160, which suggests a normal heart rhythm. This is also in direct opposition to the findings in the previous patient (ESR of 120).
