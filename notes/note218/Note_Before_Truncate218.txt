PROMPT:

Assessment / Plan: Follow-up in 3 months

RESPONSE:

 .  Dental Intervention: Follow-up until permanent dentures are in place.  Periodic Oral Health Follow-up visits: 2 (4 months to 3 years).  Probiodic Screening: Periodic testing for plaque with a staining test, oral rinse exam, biopsies, and tooth sensitivity.  Management Options / Safety Considerations: For patients with dental caries, management includes:  Regular evaluation of caries and tooth loss.  Caries may occur with the development of other oral conditions with no history of oral disease, such as periodontal disease, periodontal infection, systemic candidiasis, and tooth decay secondary to dental procedures (eg, root canal treatment and periodontal decompression).  Periodontal evaluation should also consider caries prevention, and the presence of secondary dental lesions.  Tooth loss may be as a result of periodontitis. Periodontal conditions can be self-limited or may cause chronic problems for a long period of time.  Fluoride may reduce the risk of future dental caries development. Dental caries is caused by the accumulation of plaque in the teeth, especially in the gums, on the roots of both teeth, and on the dental hard tissues surrounding the teeth. Caries plaque is difficult to remove and usually accumulates slowly over time and over various stages of life. Caries is the number one cause of tooth loss in the United States. Caries causes approximately 40 percent of all tooth decay and tooth loss and is the major cause of decay in adults. [1] The disease is also responsible for approximately 10 percent of dental health care expenditures in the United States. Caries is a major public-health problem in children. In the United States, about 14 million American children aged 6 to 11 have caries. [2]  For more information see:  [1] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
