**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making (MDM): Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

He does not have a recent history of tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. He does however have an unclassifiable disease. The Patient's primary care cardiologist notes that the ECG is "almost normal," that no previous medical history of atrial fibrillation is available or available if that's a concern, that the patient's family medical history does not include symptoms of atrial fibrillation, and does note that the patient presents with a history of intermittent claudication.
