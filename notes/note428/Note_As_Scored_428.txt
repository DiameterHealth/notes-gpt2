PROMPT:

HPI Comments This is Medicare wellness visit. Patient reports with no complaints and is currently taking atorvastatin for lipid management and aspirin OTC daily

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

. Comments: One patient complained of bloating and a little constipation from the combination of aspirin and atorvastatin OTC. This is one of the few situations in which I would advise a patient not to switch medications until a physician is trained in the pharmacokinetics of aspirin. For the average patient, using the same medication twice a day does not seem to cause much bother.
