PROMPT:

SUBJECTIVE This is a 72-year-old male with history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft

RESPONSE:

  (CABG) surgery, asthma and bronchitis. No current substance abuse. EDITED ENGLISH VERSION: DHEA is an anabolic steroid, an antagonist of the DHEA uptake transporters which allow uptake of dihydrotestosterone into the liver. Since the DHEA transporter is found in the brain and peripheral tissues, DHEA can influence central and peripheral nervous system function and the immune response of athletes and non-athletes respectively. DHEA may also increase muscle mass, promote increased fat synthesis and strength.  FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIVES: Assessing the effects of DHEA and the potential mechanisms linking these activities is needed to understand its potential ergogenic/anabolic effects in athletes. Studies to investigate safety should address the long term effects of this performance enhancing substance. In addition, studies should address the effect of DHEA on bone health, its potential benefits on athletes who have compromised hepatic function (for example, those with alcoholic liver disease), its effects on the immune system, and its potential ergogenic/anabolic activities at the human genetic level.
