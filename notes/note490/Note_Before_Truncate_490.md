**PROMPT:**

HISTORY & PHYSICAL Patient has concerns including Rash. Itchy rash started yesterday AM on face. Was red, faded, then more red and tender in afternoon. Took benadryl once yesterday with history of no new food or products

**RESPONSE:**

  added to face for a few days. Did not see any new rash or bumps. Took benadryl once again but with more redness, but the rash remained. Today I took another benadryl, but no new rash. Took another benadryl, but no new rash. Took another benadryl, but new rash/ bumps appeared. Took benadryl once again, and again new rash/ bumps/ redness. Took benadryl twice. I'm pretty sure I have rashes now. They have been present for 5 days. I am in the final stages of my exam to become a Certified Aeternitita Nurse Practitioner (AANP). I have seen the same face today, and it is red, and hot and feels dry. I took a benadryl again after I got home, but did not see any new rash or bumps. I think my AANP is in process - so will take a benadryl today, and keep it on through Monday to see if it does anything. However, I'm not going to take it twice, because it's just too sensitive to get so upset about, and the effects are temporary. So I had a pretty tough time deciding between this and benadryl. But I just wanted to let you know I have made a decision about what I am going to take for my exam, as I am very uncomfortable with anything that has so many negative effects. Thank you for your post.
