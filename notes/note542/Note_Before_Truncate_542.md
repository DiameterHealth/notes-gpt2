**PROMPT:**

HPI This is a follow-up visit for diabetes management and for management of glucose control. The pt was previously referred to a nephrologist

**RESPONSE:**

  for a complete nephrolithiasis treatment including removal of the nephric duct as required. His current nephrology history including use of steroids and antihypertensives was negative. On the post surgery management he was given the option of receiving a combined oral antidiabetic and steroid medication if desired. The pt was scheduled for treatment two months later. The nephrologist was advised of the need to monitor this patient for several years due to the potential for long-term renal failure. He received a complete nephrolithiasis study including complete endoscopic nephrolithotomy. In all nephrology evaluations, the pt reported normal blood pressure, no significant cardiac or neurologic deficits, and normal imaging studies. These were all normal upon follow-up. During this follow-up, the patient continued to be able to carry on a normal lifestyle.  Fatal Hypertension In May of 2010, during a routine office visit of a 57 year old male patient in a healthy weight, this patient presented with a large systolic blood pressure decrease of 120 mmHg. He told the physician the blood pressure was controlled by his own medications. He had no prior medical history of cardiovascular problems, hypertension, or diabetes. He noted having had a slight weight loss in the past months. On initial examination, he was diagnosed with pre-existing hypertension and suspected of hypertensive nephropathy due to a prior nephrostomy and a large LVH in 2008. On blood pressure testing, there remained a systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg with an average QTc of approximately 200 ms. His average creatinine was 300 mg/dl and his sodium/potassium ratio was 4.9, all of borderline significance. On echocardiogram, cardiac output was estimated to be 488 bpm with an atrial weight of 70.0 g and an in-flavour echocardiogram in 2010 suggested no evidence of cardiac disease. The pt was transferred to a local hospital and admitted by ambulance for further evaluation and further management. At the time of his admission, the patient was having an initial course of oral antidiabetic medication from the nephrologist. This dose was decreased to 40 mg once a day. However, despite this therapy, the patient's blood pressure continued to decrease over the following days. He underwent a complete nephrogastrectomy to correct for his LVH. At this visit, he was noted to have persistent LVH (
