**PROMPT:**

Assessment / Plan: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist

**RESPONSE:**

 . The patient requires intermittent or continuous, or non-intravenous, nitroglycerin with IV nitroglycerin infusion, or IV nitroglycerin infusion only during clinical crises or severe asthma attacks.  The following patients were excluded from the study: patients with acute lung injury, the need for mechanical ventilation; patients with severe lung disease, diabetes, or the need for continuous IV nitroglycerin for hypoglycemia (defined as an oral glucose/glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin > 7%); patients with chronic heart failure; and patients who were already receiving inhaled glucagon (4). An oral glucose tolerance test on day 1 of the study was not done because none were tested. Each individual's baseline blood glucose, HbA1c, fasting serum insulin, and mean plasma cortisol values were compared to the average of the other subjects.  Statistical Analysis  Data were analyzed in a 2×2 factorial ANOVA with baseline HbA1c as the dependent variable. The first 2 contrasts were used to evaluate the effect of ketones on mean insulin levels at rest, and HbA1c. The third contrast was used to evaluate the effect of ketones and IV nitroglycerin on mean leptin level at rest. For cortisol values, a repeated-measures ANOVA procedure was used with baseline and final post-ketone test as the independent variables. The analysis of cortisol levels was performed to show if there was a difference between the pre- and post-ketosis cortisol levels.  Results  Study population  The sample of participants was healthy adult Chinese males. A total of 34 subjects were enrolled in the study, with an initial baseline HbA1c of 8.5% and an eventual mean HbA1c of 5.5%. The mean age of the healthy men was 32 years ± 9.7 (SEM), and 19 were male; 11 were male in the ketosis and 17 in the non-ketosis groups. Five women were also enrolled in the study for the research of ketones effect in pregnant females. A total of 31 healthy pregnant females were enrolled, and their first HbA1c was 13.1%, while their final HbA1c was 9.2%.  Patients' baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics regarding race or sex between the subjects in the ketosis and non-ketosis groups.  TABLE 1
