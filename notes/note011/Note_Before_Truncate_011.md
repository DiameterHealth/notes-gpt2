**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Plan:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction

**RESPONSE:**

  .  Management:  Initiate conservative management for hypotension and dehydration and initiate a 3rd IV line 1 hour post induction with 5.24mm in the right lower lobe.  Radiographic Findings:  Cardiac troponin, 8.8ng/ml  Auscultation, 120s  Treatment:  Immediately initiate therapy with the following options:  1. IV nitroglycerine  2. Intravenous fluids (60% 1L Nolvasan/10% NPH O2, 1.5 L saline)  3. Intravenous cefixime and ceftriaxone.  4. Inclusion in the ACC/AHA guideline for AML management ( http://www3.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/athletic-med-societies/athletic-medicine-guidelines_20130812_16_aml  5. An elective surgery (at this point, only cefixime is recommended).  6. If surgery was not performed:  1. Antibiotic infusion (2 gm cefixime/ 1 gm ceftriaxone within 2 hours of admission)  2. IV amiodarone 400 mg q 20 mins for vasoconstriction (this needs to be repeated every 3 days during induction therapy)  3. IV digoxin (20 mg q 20 mins for hypotension after cefixime)  4. Intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg t 6 mins after admission; if cefixime failure and/or hypovolemia persists  Treatment of cardiac arrythmias: (may include, but is not limited to: ACE inhibitors, beta -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or Î² -blockers.)1  Mild symptoms:  Treatment:  1. ACE inhibitors (including atenolol)  2. Beta-blockers: CGRP receptor block is associated with vasovagal syncope;  3. CGRP receptor block can reduce heart rate and blood pressure with the resulting hypotension.  Severe symptoms:  Treatment:  1. ACE inhibitors: In patients with mild symptoms, a 10-mg/kg dose of oral ACE inhibitor may be administered with the initial dose
