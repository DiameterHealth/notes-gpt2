RESPONSE:

 . He has seen specialists, but has been unable to resolve the problem with any other treatment. Surgical removal of both eyes is performed. Examination in the emergency room is suggestive of retinal detachment. The patient requests surgical intervention and follow-up is at 3 months.  PIPI On the patient's initial appearance, a diagnosis of retinal detachments and cataracts is made. This patient has received no other retinal surgeries. The primary suspicion is cataracts, but an MRI of the optic vessels in the left eye and optic nerve on the left side shows no abnormality. The doctor performs an ophthalmological examination, which is positive for retinal detachment with visual fields >100 degrees. A cataract surgery is recommended.  TBI The patient presents with head injury. After he completes a concussion evaluation, the doctor recommends a CT scan. An ophthalmological examination is positive for bilateral diffuse retinal detachment with visual fields in the normal range. A cataract surgery is recommended.  PIPI At 10 weeks post-injury, the patient presents with mild dizziness as well as some facial tinnitus. He also has a very high incidence of facial and upper extremity pain. The ophthalmic exam is negative for fractures or traumatic injuries. The doctor diagnoses bilateral diffuse retinal detachment with visual fields in the normal range. A cataract surgery is recommended.  TBI While he is evaluated for potential post-injury neurologic or neurologic events, tests to rule out traumatic injury become the primary focus. A CT scan of the head, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck are performed. A CT scan of the right eye and left eye (peripheral and central retinal detachment) and some visual fields are found to be normal. However, a CT scan of the head can be positive for traumatic injury of the neck. A CT scan of the patient's neck indicates no apparent trauma. However, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the right eye (peripheral detachment) can be found to be positive. Additional brain tests confirm that the patient had no traumatic lesions. As a precaution, treatment with analgesics should be initiated, and the follow-up visit is at 3 months.  PIPI The patient presents with nausea and vomiting, but after examination tests, a diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is made. A CT scan can be performed, which shows no focal trauma.
