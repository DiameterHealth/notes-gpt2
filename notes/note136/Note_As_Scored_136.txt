RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

.  VAGINAL HAEMORRHOID:  Patient was not monitored at all during her entire hospitalization. She did not receive the standard of care vaginal douching. It may be that the severity in her condition was not as severe, thus making it more difficult for her to urinate. The patient's case is an example of why vaginal douching and other forms of female genital mutilation are not acceptable.
