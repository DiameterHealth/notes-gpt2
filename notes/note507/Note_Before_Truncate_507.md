**RESPONSE:**

 , and recent surgery for heart valve replacement. The medical history of this individual was extensive. He had a history of alcoholism, depression, anorexia, and venous insufficiency. He was also receiving H&Ps at the time of the accident. He reported to be moderately conscious in the ED but was confused and agitated both in the ED and at the time of the crash. He denied medication and alcohol, but claimed to have a full memory of the accident. He was given a blood pressure medication and told that he might feel better. He was advised to "sleep it off." There was no indication that he had been depressed or was a danger to himself or others. He was admitted into the emergency department, and he reported a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction (LVAD), and acute coronary syndrome. He was treated with thiotepa and aspirin. He was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU), and was initially discharged after his LVAD was stable. However, there was no further improvement in his symptoms. He remained in the unit and was subsequently transferred to the cardiac rehabilitation unit. A subsequent echocardiography was ordered, but it revealed no significant change in the LVAD or left ventricular function. The patient was then transferred to cardiology. On admission to the cardiology unit, the LVAD was unstable, and he had a high risk of rebleeding in the event of a secondary myocardial infarction. A cardiorespiratory bypass was performed using an atrioventricular catheter, without mechanical ventilation. There was marked transient hypotension, tachycardia, and metabolic acidosis within the right ventricular septum, with a marked diastolic response to sinus tachycardia. The left atrium was still dilated and nonperfusing, indicating aortic-valve failure. Aortic rupture was considered to be imminent. Two cardiac enzymes (Coombi's and troponin) were also elevated at initial evaluation. Blood pressure was measured with an arterialized cuff. Blood glucose levels were taken with an automated continuous glucose meter. A second echocardiography revealed a normal LVAD and a complete right atrial relaxation on right ventricular pressure monitoring. There were 2% diffuse elevations in the right atrium and sinus node on this echocardiography. The LVAD was stable and the aortic valve appeared to be non-responsive.
