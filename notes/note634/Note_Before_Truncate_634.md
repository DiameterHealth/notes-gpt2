**PROMPT:**

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  25 y/o F presents to the ED with R knee pain and bilateral ankle pain following a fall. Pt states she fell down x2 steps onto cement. States she twisted her ankles and R knee.

**RESPONSE:**

  No physical examination, pain on x-ray, or ultrasound of hips found. No other injuries.  Discussion There have been a number of cases reported that present with similar symptoms [28-31]. Our patient was a middle aged white female. Her presentation was unusual as she presented with 3 orthopaedic conditions, R and L knee pain, ankle pain, and lumbar pain. She was seen twice in the ED. She initially presented with right knee pain; however, an examination revealed she was presenting with symptoms from her left knee which also began to ache at the time of admission to the ED. There was no history of falls. She initially refused a full physical evaluation. However, she accepted that her left knee and ankle were a source of pain. She did not have other injuries. She was seen two times in the ED; first for assessment of R and L symptoms; and second for examination of her ankle. Both times, she declined a full physical examination. Her symptoms returned the next day. She was eventually admitted to the ICU for evaluation of her lumbar radiculopathy secondary to her ankle and knee problems. The patient's pain at the time of admission to the ICU was moderate with pain at the front of her thigh and the back of the leg. However, the radicular pain had increased to the level of a 9 on a 10 point scale on radiographs of L1 and L2 in an ankle/knee joint. The patient denied any signs of infection except the radiographic signs of tenderness on the lateral aspect of the ankle and posteriorly of the left knee and ankle. She had no history of upper extremity trauma. She refused an additional MRI scan of the ankle for an R diagnosis during her stay in the ICU. However, she received a MR imaging done while in the ICU suggesting bilateral ankle and medial thigh radiations. Lumbar radiculopathy, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is associated with an abnormal mass development of multiple small bones. MRI and CT studies show abnormalities in axial spine in patients with this diagnosis [32]. For example, the L1-2 region is enlarged in the presence of radiculopathy [33]. MRI results in the ankle and knee regions from our patient are consistent with the reported findings from studies in patients with radiculopathy [9, 10, 31, 34, 35]. The ankle MRI showed the anterior of the tibia and the distal phaloacetic joint were
