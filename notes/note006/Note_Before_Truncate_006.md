**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Plan:  Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension 

**RESPONSE:**

 ileus will allow for a thorough evaluation of a possible renal impairment that could be due to a kidney disease related to heredity, age, or surgery.  Management Plan: Pt's medical history, physical exam, and urinalysis will reveal the presence of any medications that could be contributing to the observed dysfunction, which will need to be addressed with a long-term (e.g. lifelong) management plan; however, Pt may be at a higher-than-average risk due to an uncontrolled diabetes.  Treatment: Treatment management will focus on the goal of preventing Pt from becoming acutely insulin resistant or developing type 2 diabetes.  Pre-Op:  Pt will be enrolled and will be enrolled in his usual medication protocol and will be evaluated during his stay in the ICU with a PSA test and a complete blood count. After the ICU stay, Pt will be evaluated by a podiatrist for a complete physical exam and urinalysis (e.g. creatinine, urea and albumin) before commencing treatment.  Day: Pt's physical exam, urological exams, urinalysis and PSA test will begin once he arrives at the ICU on the evening before surgery (day 15). A PSA test on day 6, and an additional PSA test on day 8 will help determine if surgery or prolonged ICU stay is required. PT will be scheduled in the morning hours of day 8 to ensure that Pt is awake and alert so that he may be safely sedated the morning of surgery. Pt's Urinalysis, including creatinine, urea and albumin will also be performed.  Surgical Day: The operative day will be defined by the PT who will perform the surgery; the day will begin on the morning of day 1 and continue until Pt is stable but alert and comfortable with a feeding tube.  Pre-operative and Post-operative: The PT will perform a CT scan (with or without contrast), a PSA test, and a complete blood count (CBC). The PT will continue to monitor PTs blood pressures and serum electrolytes, especially potassium, as this is a major risk factor for the development of diabetes postoperatively.   Pre-Operative Assessment: A routine physical exam is conducted in Pt during the pre-operative assessment. The PT will be in Pt's hospital room to assist the family or care giver to select the best method of transportation for the patient while en route to the facility
