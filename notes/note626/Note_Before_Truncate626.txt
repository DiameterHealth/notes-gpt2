PROMPT:

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  Patient reports itchy eyes, runny nose and other symptoms of allergic rhinitis

RESPONSE:

 . Patient has skin rash around face and lips.  Case Summary  A 34 year old female presented to our unit 3 days after a trip to China as the sole companion of a family member.  She had a headache, runny nose and sore throat. She took an over-the-counter cold and cough medications as recommended.  She started having severe skin rashes about 1 week after returning home. She began to complain of hives on her face and hands. She stopped using the cold and cough medications as recommended.  On physical exam she said she was unable to recall the past 8 weeks, but believed an allergic reaction may have caused her rash. She said she thought her symptoms were allergic, but would not discuss this further.  She did not recall receiving steroid injections or any medication for her allergies.  Additional medical history revealed a diagnosis of asthma in childhood. No other allergies were noted at the initial evaluation.  Discussion  A primary care physician may not encounter many cases of allergic rhinitis and consequently may not inquire. However, if a medical condition is detected early, an alternative diagnosis, such as anaphylaxis, can be made and treatment administered appropriately.  A primary care physician should ask about symptoms of hives, skin rash or other skin symptoms if patients have no history of a family history of these symptoms or if they present to a primary care physician with unexplained symptoms.  For example, a common clinical manifestation of hives is a reaction to a substance such as insect stings, bee stings or soap. This reaction may be associated with anaphylaxis and treated accordingly.  References for this Article
