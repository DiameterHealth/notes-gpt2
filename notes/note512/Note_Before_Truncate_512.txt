PROMPT:

H&P EXAMINATION Patient presents with a fever, sore throat and overall unwell. Symptoms reported to start 5 days ago and fever has been persistent and treated with acetaminophen

RESPONSE:

 . Examination results on chest, abdomen, and upper limbs are normal. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Results from throat swabs suggest no systemic candidiasis or allergic reactions. Laboratory findings are consistent with an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and are supportive of severe systemic candidiasis. Routine antibiotic treatment is warranted as an active infection with Candida is suspected. Routine follow-up is warranted. CASE 2 Patient comes in with a fever, sore throat, and headache that persists. Examination reveals severe dysuria, urine output is <40 ml/24 h, and blood pressure 130/80. Examination of throat, sinus, urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid reveals signs of Candida infection. Laboratory findings are consistent with an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and are supportive of severe systemic candidiasis. Antibiotics are prescribed as a result of a suspected Candida infection. Routine follow-up is unnecessary but is indicated in the presence of a known Candida infection.
