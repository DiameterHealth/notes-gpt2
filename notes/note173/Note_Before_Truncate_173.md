 ; no evidence to advocate for continued medication at this time."  Summary: It appears to be a pretty standard report for what is a routine case for a very young girl with a history of multiple and/or acute episodes of tic and/or stuttering who, when taken to the doctor, did not receive the recommendation or the support, which, based on her prior histories of developmental issues, would have likely led to further diagnosis of autism based on the child's presentation.  Clinicians should be cautious in interpreting this report. The pediatrician should, if possible, obtain a history of any family history of autism, as there may exist an underlying disorder, such as thyroid dysfunction, or a genetic condition associated with developmental delay or brain disease that predisposes to the development of these issues. It may not be unusual for a pediatrician to discover tics or stuttering (including their occurrence) without this information.  This case highlights the importance of seeking out additional assessments for children presenting with developmental delays, if there is no evidence of autism in the children's initial evaluation. A child presenting with developmental delays is potentially more vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, because their brains are not fully developing, and the early symptoms can be misinterpreted as evidence of autism.  For children with a history of or family member with Autism Spectrum Disorder we recommend, for some children, an exploration of their tics or stuttering, and referral for further evaluation. For our patients with no history of autism, or a family history of this disorder, a more standard report is recommended because they are more likely to have the underlying cause for autism. This is because of a greater likelihood that it is a developmental disorder and not one inherent to the autism spectrum.  References:  Klein DA, Wozniak KJ.
