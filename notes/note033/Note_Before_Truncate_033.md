**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE:**

  The patient is referred to the orthopaedic surgeon. The orthopaedic surgeon will carefully diagnose the diagnosis which is a combination of patella dislocation and degenerative changes in both hips. The surgical procedure will be divided into an emergency intervention and a planned follow-up.  Discussion:  The patient who did not have a history of hip fracture prior to a previous hip replacement procedure due to a complete rupture of the calcified synovium within 10 weeks of the previous hip fracture will develop anterior compartment syndrome in the second attempt [1]. This complication is extremely serious, can lead to mortality, and will require immediate amputation, if not a complete disarticulation of his entire left hip. This complication should be treated with meticulous, patient centric care, as per the "Patient Centric Care" Principles described in the World Hip Surgery Day 2012. These principles were developed to promote best practice in the field of hip arthroplasty and hip osteoarthritis management. In simple words, there are three steps that should be followed with a patient with this problem. You must first identify the potential causes of their pain and discomfort, identify their surgical interventions based on the diagnosis, ensure the best outcome will be achieved, and then provide continuing rehabilitation following the amputation to prevent further progression.  Discussion:  The main issue regarding this complication is that, as in this case, there is an infection that is present in both hips where the operative procedures were performed. This infection must be controlled during the incisional procedures, and this must be done surgically as per the World Hip Surgery Day 2012.  Discussion:  This is one reason why patients are typically referred to orthopaedic surgeons and orthopedic surgeons for hip arthroplasty who have complete arthroplasty techniques [3].  Discussion:  It has been found in the literature that, in most patients, as soon as one or more of these areas of degenerative changes in the hips have progressed, there is a significant chance of relapse of the symptoms in the following surgery [4]. The authors of this paper have presented a case of a patient who failed to experience an effective response to treatment despite having performed his previous three surgical procedures. The patients symptoms were so bad, that despite the fact that the patient was not in pain on the day he experienced his first pain, after a subsequent visit, he was found to be in pain and experienced his third pain. He was then admitted to the ICU, where it
