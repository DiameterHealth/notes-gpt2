**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

The patient is referred to the orthopaedic surgeon. The orthopaedic surgeon will carefully diagnose the diagnosis which is a combination of patella dislocation and degenerative changes in both hips. The surgical procedure will be divided into an emergency intervention and a planned follow-up. Discussion:  The patient who did not have a history of hip fracture prior to a previous hip replacement procedure due to a complete rupture of the calcified synovium within 10 weeks of the previous hip fracture will develop anterior compartment syndrome in the second attempt [1].
