PROMPT:

Plan of Treatment:  Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications

RESPONSE:

 . It is not certain that this will lead to continued reduction in the number of days in the hospital.  Treatment:  Patient was given oral rehydration solution. After 4 days she was discharged home.  Outcomes (N = 4): Outcome at 6 weeks was confirmed to be a reduction in the hospital stay from 24+3 days to 7+2 days (p = 0.0009) although the improvement did not last. Outcome at 2 years was not recorded but is included in the manuscript (p = 0.0008). Treatment group was assigned to follow-up (2 years from day 3 of hospitalization). One patient in the maintenance group stopped therapy for unknown reasons on day 4 of hospitalization despite being advised to follow-up and taking the prescribed medication.  Results:  Both the drug and the medication group experienced a benefit (p<0.05) at 6 weeks after initial treatment. There was no improvement in outcome at 2 years. The primary endpoint remained the same however both drug and medication groups experienced significant improvements compared with baseline (p<0.05).
