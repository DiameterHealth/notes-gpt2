Post-transfusion Hemorrhage  Hemorrhagic stroke is the most common serious stroke during anticoagulation therapy and occurs when the bleeding is interrupted during blood coagulation. The risk of hemorrhage from any anticoagulation therapy is increased in patients with significant bleeding. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs most commonly in patients with previous hemorrhage and when the bleeding occurs during a time of the day or when the patient is not in an upright position. Most bleeding is self-limited in nature, unless there is a marked bleeding risk factor, e.g., preeclampsia, pre-eclampsia, or uncontrolled hypertension. Most bleeding is transient.  The incidence of cerebrovasculitic hemorrhage (CSHL) from any anticoagulant is about 1 in 10,000-20,000 doses of warfarin (for patients less than 50 years of age) and about 1 in 2,000-4,000 doses of heparin (for patients 50 years of age or older), but the incidence is even greater during the first and second half of the anticoagulant period.  There have been isolated cases of CSHL from long-term administration of warfarin in adults, infants, and children during the first or second half of the anticoagulant period. The risk of CSHL is greatest around the times when antiplatelet agents are administered. In addition, bleeding can occur during initiation of antithrombotic therapy, initiation of antithrombotic therapy may be delayed, treatment-induced hypercoagulability may occur, and the anticoagulant activity is not totally eliminated. As a result, the overall chance of CSHL is elevated when antiplatelet agents are prescribed. The risk of CSHL rises in patients who have pre-existing bleeding problems, have other diseases or illnesses which predispose to bleeding, or have received a previous anticoagulant.  Other mechanisms of injury (e.g., pulmonary emboli, cerebral hemorrhage of unknown etiology), drug interactions (e.g., with the concomitant use of angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), and medications (e.g., nitrates, thiazides) which may affect clotting factors increase the risk of
