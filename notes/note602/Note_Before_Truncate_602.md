**PROMPT:**

Past Medical History This is a follow-up visit for diabetes management and for management of glucose control. The pt was previously referred to a nephrologist

**RESPONSE:**

  for a history of diabetes mellitus, and has been taking sulfonylureas/Glucophage for the past six months. Pt was taking metformin (200 mg/d) for one year when he was referred for evaluation; he is taking metformin for an additional year. This past history was significant with regard to the potential for recurrent episodes of diabetes. A complete physical examination was conducted, and he was given insulin, glyburide, and sulfonylureas/Glucophage. During this time, he also was seen by a nephrologist and underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate-specific gland. Pt continued taking sulfonylureas/Glucophage, metformin, and metformin-containing medicines for diabetes management, but he is currently taking them as he feels that his condition has improved.  Statistical Analysis Serum Insulin Levels As planned, serum insulin levels were measured the night before the procedure at 4 and 8 hours postoperatively. The procedure was performed in a fasting state from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. for the measurement of serum insulin levels. At the onset of surgery at 11:30 a.m., a standard insulin infusion and glucose infusion was performed. After 12:00 p.m., serum insulin levels were measured using an Insulin RIA, a glucose RIA, the glucometer (Glucometer III), and the analyzer on the medical equipment. For measurement of insulin levels, an individual was required to have normal blood-sugar, serum insulin, and plasma glucose values (the use of the same insulin in insulin-treated participants in a trial on glyburide did not significantly alter the results as expected because they did not differ significantly). The measurement was considered to have a valid sample if it was achieved by less than 10% error, as determined by comparing mean values from the individual and the reference. A non-intact blood sample was taken to measure fasting plasma glucose. Insulin RIA Insulin RIA analyzers (Insulin Analytic, Inc., San Leandro, California) were used to analyze all available measurements as follows: serum insulin was measured using 0.35 U/L insulin with a reference range of 0.20 to 0.35 U/L. Plasma glucose was measured with a glucometer at 0.5 U/L. Serum glyburide was measured with a gl
