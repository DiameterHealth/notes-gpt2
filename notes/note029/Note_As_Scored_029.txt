RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

She continued to take aspirin and metronidazole but experienced significant pain later in the day when driving. She resumed aspirin and metronidazole but experienced some additional pain in the morning when driving. She has now stopped taking aspirin and metronidazole although the pain was still moderate. There will be future studies to determine how the body responds to low-dose aspirin/metronidazole with the same or different analgesics, and if more pain can be managed with a higher dose (eg, 325 mg of aspirin/metronidazole).
