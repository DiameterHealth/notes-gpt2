**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Recommendation:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.

**RESPONSE:**

  She continued to take aspirin and metronidazole but experienced significant pain later in the day when driving. She resumed aspirin and metronidazole but experienced some additional pain in the morning when driving. She has now stopped taking aspirin and metronidazole although the pain was still moderate. There will be future studies to determine how the body responds to low-dose aspirin/metronidazole with the same or different analgesics, and if more pain can be managed with a higher dose (eg, 325 mg of aspirin/metronidazole). Discussion:  This case demonstrates that low-dose aspirin with metronidazole may be appropriate and may help avoid some of the toxic effects of metronidazole therapy. A discussion with the patient in this case noted that she would like to stop taking metronidazole, but has felt that this treatment was necessary so as not to have a life-threatening complication that may have been caused by the metronidazole. Her physician has since changed her physician and is now using a lower dose of aspirin which allows her to have oral sex without serious adverse effects. She says that she is still having some difficulties at work and is frustrated to feel that the medication that is providing the benefit in the present case may be reducing the benefit when it appears that it is actually worsening the discomfort/sensitivity. For this patient, these issues (and the increased risk that the patient has of developing an IV line in situ or developing some type of IV obstruction) might well outweigh any benefits that the patient might expect to be obtained from the study of low-dose aspirin/metronidazole.  Clinical Questions:  Is aspirin/metronidazole for acute pain associated with increased likelihood of developing an ischemic event that requires intravenous access or is aspirin/metronidazole for pain associated with developing an IV obstruction associated with an increased chance of experiencing a toxic effect such as an increased risk of infection?  Additional Information:  In a recent abstract by Dr. Eisele et al. (2008) [8] concerning the management and outcome of patients with acute pain and hypotension, they described that they did not recommend aspirin/metronidazole to their patients, since the use of these medications have been demonstrated to be associated with IV obstruction.
