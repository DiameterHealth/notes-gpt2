PROMPT:

HPI Comments The patient presents with a fever and shortness of breath associated with community acquired pneumonia

RESPONSE:

 . Her vital signs are: BP 123/80 mmHg, PaO2 89%, RR 12/min, RRP 24 cm H2O, and RACs 2.7%. On physical exam, she is uncoordinated, has a large, warm, tender, and red inflamed erythematous lesion covering the upper torso. Her chest X-ray does not reveal evidence of pneumonia. Chest radiographs do show large, soft-tissue, subcutaneous masses in the left-rear chest wall (Figures and ). On abdominal radiographs, there is a mild pericardiocentesis, with multiple small, bilateral peri-atrial nodal masses. Open in a separate window There are several clinical features of the patient that suggest a multidrug resistant pneumococcal pneumonia, including the following: the patient has no history of drug use and did not receive antibiotic therapy as indicated; the patient presents with a fever of 102ºF (38.3ºC) with chills and low-grade fever; the patient is unresponsive and has a blood pressure of 123/80 mmHg with a pulse rate of 12/min; and the patient has severe upper airway obstruction with a positive forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) of more than 50%.  Discussion The association between resistant pneumococci and the use of antimicrobial agents increased substantially in 2003 following the emergence of multiple antibiotic-resistant strains with high levels of resistance to cephalosporins (BV, carbapenems, and sulfonamides).13 The combination of the emergence of multiple-drug resistant strains, particularly cephalosporins that are not active against all of the selected antibiotics at once, and the subsequent increased use of antibiotics is of particular concern because the resistance patterns of resistant strains have remained largely unchanged in most of these cases despite many years of increasing antibiotic use.13 Several factors could contribute to the development of resistant pneumococci in humans. These include the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains in the population, an increased number of drug resistant and carbapenem resistant strains in particular bacterial isolates, and the increased use of antibiotics that are not effective against all of the selected antibiotics. This combination of factors increases the risk of developing drug resistant pneumococcal pneumonia.14,15 In addition, the number of reported cases of drug-resistant pneumococci in children under 7 years of age has increased over time.16,17 During 2002
