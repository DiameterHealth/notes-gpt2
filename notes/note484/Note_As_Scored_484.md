**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

********  I see and am able to make out the outlines of the object, although a very faint one at this distance. When the object is near enough to the eye it becomes more vivid. I have frequently seen the object surrounded by a brilliant light; this was a white glare, like that produced by the glare of lightning. This phenomenon was always produced by a flash from some concealed source and never at a distance of more than 2 ft., when the object being seen at some distance from the eye appears white and opaque.
