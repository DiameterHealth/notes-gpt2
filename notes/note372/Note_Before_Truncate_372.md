For adults aged 18 years or older, a history of fever of > 38ºC on three separate occasions is required and patients older than 18 years must have an E. coli skin test positive for C. difficile at the time of hospital admission.  Patient's cough is present and stable on a continuous basis, with the exception of a cough that lasts longer than 1 hour, is accompanied by nasal discharge, or is preceded by an episode of increased abdominal pain or a sense of "stomach flu".

The following blood cultures must show > or = 99% purity and negative for enteric organisms (E. coli or Salmonella spp. may also be used with a higher level of specificity; however, in vitro detection of these organisms can not be used in place of a positive culture for Enterococcus spp.).  Listeria monocytogenes: MIC > or = 28,000 CFU/mL or culture in a positive culture should rule out L. monocytogenes.  Aposmia with methicillin-resistant
