**PROMPT:**

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  The patient is a 57 y.o. male presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath

**RESPONSE:**

 . His history is consistent with recent onset of severe headache. Medical evaluation revealed he was stable until presenting to us. He has had a history of headache in the past, but without any history of chest pain. He has no family history of heart attacks or high blood pressure. On the ECG and chest X-ray, we found a diffuse, right bundle branch block (PBBB). A small, diffuse PBBB was found on the right side of T12-15 on the T13-15 leads. On the echocardiogram, we found a low-to-no systolic filling of the RV/aortic stenosis and a systolic hypertension of more than 140/90 mm Hg. These findings were consistent with a very large RV/aortic obstruction and/or systolic hypertension. The patient had significant respiratory distress and was intubated by the team with the use of an auto-biventricular monitor. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and he was successfully reintubated and transferred to the rehabilitation unit for further evaluation. His level of consciousness was maintained, and he was discharged 8 h later.  Case Report 1 A 29 y.o. female with a history of severe migraine headaches (range: migraine frequency of 2-6 per month or higher) presenting with worsening chest pain to a local emergency department. She has had one previous episode of acute coronary syndrome as a result of her work (the most severe one to date [3 mm aortic dissection]), but her previous episode was not of concern. Her ECG findings are as follows: T12, 15; QRS: 126 ms/1.4 msec; T19, 15; T10, 3; T8, 5; T19, 15; T10, 4, T7, 6. A cardiac catheterization revealed the presence of a massive LVH; both the right and left ventricles were enlarged and dilated, whereas the normal LV is not dilated or enlarged. The cardiac catheterization was taken out on admission to the rehabilitation unit. The patient did not regain consciousness before being transferred to the rehabilitation unit. The right ventricular ejection fraction was significantly increased and atrial size was enlarged in all units. The patient remains on antihypertensive medication and was intubated during the admission procedure. She was discharged after outpatient rehabilitation and will be seen again for follow-up evaluation following return to work, which will be expected
