  to discuss his progress.  One week after the completion of his first course of antibiotics, the patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks to discuss his progress.  Conclusion:  The patient is monitored for an extended period of time during initial administration of antibiotics, in hopes of getting this condition under control. The physician is then advised to administer a second dose of antibiotics on a different day. Because of the patient's chronic nature, there are a series of follow-up visits that must occur: once a week for a week, twice a week for two weeks, and three times a week for three weeks. The doctor is also advised to monitor for the worsening of symptoms (e.g., swelling) and the onset of new episodes. If symptoms worsen, a more intensive course of antibiotics must be administered. In the worst case scenario, the patient may be referred to a specialist as soon as possible.  Antibiotic treatment for otitis media was first advocated in the 1930s but was a long-term practice to this day—especially in the United Kingdom, where an estimated 85% of adults are currently taking some form of antibiotics. These drugs have been the cornerstone in the treatment of most forms of this infection. [8]  What is often overlooked, however, is the importance of treating otitis media early. Early treatment can reduce the severity of treatment and complications, and could possibly mean the difference between permanent health problems, which have a cost of $4 billion per year in the United States, and an illness that is managed. As a result, otitis media is among the most common reasons cited by patients for not going to the doctor. [8]  The early, well-meaning physician in question—now deceased—was probably correct in recommending otitis media treatment, whether he intended to or not. Because of the importance of treating early, the following guidelines are based on current medical practice. These guidelines include recommendations from the medical community that are based on clinical research, research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and clinical experience from both physicians and the public.  In general, patients with chronic otitis media receive their antibiotics at a faster rate than those without the infection, primarily because a greater number of antibiotics are prescribed. Patients with chronic otitis media are often given an initial course of at least two courses of antibiotics. When a patient with chronic otitis media is initially treated with antibiotics, the dose prescribed should be increased after 6–12 weeks because of
