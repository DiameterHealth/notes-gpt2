Determining the cause of diarrhea in children .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. Determining the cause of diarrhea in children is a high priority for health care professionals. Your family physician can help establish the cause of your daughter's fever. A health care professional will try to diagnose diarrhea. If the child does not have an immune deficiency due to diarrhea, the health care practitioner may start an antibiotic treatment, if the child has not had a complete remission of diarrhea. This is important, as the child is not only not getting a complete remission from diarrhea but is likely to go on to get very sick or even die from a bacterial infection. If your child does not have a complete remission of diarrhea, the health care practitioner may provide intravenous (IV) fluids to treat dehydration or the child may be placed on antibiotics such as a broad-spectrum, enteric-coated, cephalosporin, which can decrease the amount of bacteria in the intestines. Your child may also be treated with a combination of different medications, such as a combination of rifaximin and/or tetracycline. When possible, the health care practitioner will use a combination of drugs to complete the course of treatment that is usually needed for the child. If the family physician is not experienced with diarrhea treatment, they will attempt to manage the child with a combination of these medications. To treat diarrhea, your health care professional may start with adding fluids, such as plain diet, to the child's diet. If the child does not have a complete remission of diarrhea, the health care practitioner may start with changing the child's diet and may also give the child IV fluids if indicated and is needed. In the very sick child with diarrhea, your health care practitioner may suggest IV nutritional supplementing. IV nutritional supplementation is an important treatment modality for diarrhea in the very sick child. Your health care practitioner should give the child the nutritional supplement(s) at the discretion of the health care practitioner, based on the child's condition, medical history and condition. ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. .......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
