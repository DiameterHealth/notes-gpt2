PROMPT:

Medical Decision Making: After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

The mass was excised completely, and a partial excision was performed. All  glandular components were removed; however, the  proximal lobe of the left gland mass was not excised, due to the rarity of the mass, and the  extracorporeal cystic drainage technique for cystic fibrosis may have been too effective. There was no  discernible effect on  hepatic variables;  the patient's hematocrit was normal and  glucose levels were normal.
