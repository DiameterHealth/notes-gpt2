PROMPT:

Medical Decision Making: After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

RESPONSE:

  The mass was excised completely, and a partial excision was performed.  All  glandular components were removed; however, the  proximal lobe of the left gland mass was not excised, due to the rarity of the mass, and the  extracorporeal cystic drainage technique for cystic fibrosis may have been too effective.  There was no  discernible effect on  hepatic variables;  the patient's hematocrit was normal and  glucose levels were normal.  No  antigliadin antibody was found on testing.  The patient was given a second dose of oral prednisone to be on-the-ball before a subsequent visit to the GI.  The patient received a second course of oral prednisone; however, she did not have any additional changes in symptoms or blood culture profile.  All  observations, lab work, and follow-up visits were unremarkable.  Based upon the information I did have, this was considered to not be a potential cause of death.  As stated, this is considered to not cause  death on current surveillance, however, I have no experience in determining the cause or death of such patients.  It is not uncommon for it to take 6 weeks for the body's immune system to return to baseline after lymphopenia, and this would have left the patient with chronic low level anti-gliadin antibodies.  A second visit is necessary to confirm whether the lymphopenia is permanent or not.
