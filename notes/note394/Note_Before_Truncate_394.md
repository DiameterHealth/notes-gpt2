**PROMPT:**

HPI 25 y/o F presents to the ED with R knee pain and bilateral ankle pain following a fall. Pt states she fell down x2 steps onto cement. States she twisted her ankles and R knee.

**RESPONSE:**

  Exam shows her right leg is stable, her left leg is unstable. There is tenderness down her foot and a small red tender area on her heel (2).  ED:  CPR: 3 min  ACR: 10 min  AMR: 10 mins  LAPT: 15.5 hrs  She has 2-3 visits to the ED each year with different injury. The R is improving but the ankle pain and knee pain seem to be chronic and long-term.  Discussion  This case presents with the presentation of an extreme case of acute trauma that can be prevented with a simple protocol:  -1) Take 2 steps backwards. If you get to the bottom of the steps and feel better then keep going!  2) When in an emergency department, always get to the nearest exit. If you can safely get to someone's room without waiting, do it. I've seen 3 patients in 2 days and we were all treated at the E at the same time, so we all got the same care.  3) Never wait for a car to arrive to see what's going on. It's far better to know what's going on before you go to the ER.  4) If you or someone you know is concerned about their safety and/or a friend or relative is hurt, tell someone and get the medical help you need.  5) Take your time with everything, walk slowly and quietly. It's better for your eyes and your hands to be busy and not be moving.  The ED will take your E history and perform history taking on you. They are well trained and have the right equipment to assess and treat the patient.
