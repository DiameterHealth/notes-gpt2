**PROMPT:**

Pertinent Clinical Presentation  Patient presents with cough and states he has flu like sx since Sunday, feels like he his progressivly getting better. This s is a well appearing male with non-productive cough, headache, chills, subjective fever, muscle aches and flu like symptoms

**RESPONSE:**

 . The clinical signs are consistent with infection with a Mycoplasma pneumoniae.  History of travel related illness and recent onset of fever and cough: Traveler 1 had recent onset of fever and cough, as well as cough and chills. Traveler 2 had a week long history of fever and coughing with short episodes of chills and fatigue. Traveler 3 was taking antibiotics.  Physical exam results are negative for illness, fever and cough. The differential for traveler A's infections is traveler 1 (nonproductive cough, fever, chills, fatigue) and traveler 2 (chronic fever with short bouts of chills). The differential for traveler 2's infections is traveler 3 (chronic fever with short bouts of chills).  Pulmonary exam findings are unchanged from previous episodes.  TREATMENT The treatment for this patient is not clear, because the first patient died. The treatment for traveler 1 should be continued with antibiotic prophylaxis, the antibiotics have a rapid clearance rate. TACKLE: The patient should be treated for suspected nonproductive cough. Traveler 3 needs prophylactic antibiotic treatment, and traveler 4 should be hospitalized. Patient 5 should be re-evaluated 2 weeks after arrival in a health-care facilities. It has been speculated that traveler 5 can be treated similarly to patient 4, as the same antibiotic should be used in the hospital setting. However, it may be difficult to distinguish the difference (the only way that may be obvious is the location of the symptoms). Patients will also need to be re-evaluated when they return from their visit to the United States as their cough continues to recur.  CONCLUSION In summary, the diagnosis is difficult to confirm in this patient presentation. The illness is very similar to viral pneumonia, and there are specific clinical features that make this a clear case of Mycoplasma pneumonia. Patients with fever and cough are common presentations after travel. There is also a trend for severe illness after returning to a place where M pneumonia is present. The patient with traveler 4, who died, was not hospitalized. The mortality rate associated with this infection could not be determined.
