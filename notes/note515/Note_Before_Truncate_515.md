 , and that he has experienced a recent significant drop in his PCT. He denies any impairment or neurologic disorder, and the history is nontraumatic. There is a recent fall, during which he reported that his vision was blurry throughout the daytime. (1) A second exam, with a low-power magnification, reveals clear retinal tears, as well. (2) The patient is noted to be in a good state of medical awareness, with no evidence of visual disturbances or seizure during the exam. He denies prior headaches, a history of substance abuse, or any other neurologic disorder. In light of the positive results of the initial eye exam and the absence of seizures during the exam, the diagnosis of glaucoma of the eye is made (Tables 15-16).  TABLE 15-16. Glaucoma of the Eye: The Presentation, Examination, and Possible Etiology  Presentation  The patient is in good health. There are no signs of recent ocular disease or trauma. He has a good history of no prior ocular trauma. He has had a normal PCT for the past 10 years. Eye examination  At the exam, the patient can be seen to have a mild, cloudy retinal surface. Both anterior and posterior segments of the retina are evident. Both lens elements, including the anterior, are markedly reduced. In some areas, the lens elements are almost completely out of the anterior chamber (exterior segment). There is considerable intraocular pressure and partial vision is possible, although it is somewhat variable. In some locations, the lens is visible within the anterior chamber (pseudonuclear cell) or anterior chamber (laser-assisted glaucoma). There is normal retinal tears, but they are not clearly visible with the lowest power of the camera lens. The eye is normal in retinal blood flow (RBC) and in vascular density (VBD) values. There is a good seal of the anterior chamber, with adequate ocular drainage, but the eye is not fully drained by the lens and it is easy for water to enter. Examination of the retina reveals a large degree of central and distal foveal retinal bleeding. A central hemorrhage occurs mainly in the posterior segment, whereas the distal hemorrhage is more common in the anterior segment. The anterior segment has a large degree of retinal tearing. In both eyes, retinal hemorrhage is most clearly observed in the central region with the greatest hemorrhage. No additional ret
