.  Prognosis: In a general population of adults with MS, survival rate is greater than 80% when compared to MS patients with the same severity, stage, and diagnosis. Clinical Relevance: This study supports the role of the CD4 T-cell response in MS. This is demonstrated to be higher in the patients with MS compared to MS patients with the same disease activity, stage, and diagnosis; this finding provides a new avenue for clinical development of CD4-targeted therapies for MS.
