**RESPONSE:**

  (CABG) operations at a young age and obesity. He has an extensive history of renal and hepatic failure and is receiving a hemodialysis therapy. He has undergone surgery for gastritis in 2003 and has undergone three bypasses. He has been previously treated for non-small cell, acute myeloid leukemia. Physical examination revealed diffuse erythematous maculo-papillomatosis, diffuse perivascular edema, elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase <1.6 times upper limit of normal, alanine transaminase ≤5 × upper limit of normal and transaminase 50 IU/L <45 IU/L), and increased renal blood flow. He was diagnosed with early stages of hepatitis E. His plasma renin activity was <30 μmol/L (normal 50–100 μmol/L) and was in the range of patients in the category of stage 3 and higher (normal: 20–30 μmol/L). His liver enzymes were more than 3-fold above the upper limit of normal. Histologically, he presented a mixed lymphocytic and monocytic appearance on the left side of his body, with scattered large lymphocytes and intercostal spaces. He had a prominent mass of fibrotic liver nodules that protruded from the posterior abdominal wall. He also had diffuse inflammatory liver infiltrates. Plasma samples showed liver function abnormal (alanine transaminase), elevated liver enzymes, and a significant increase in total plasma bilirubin. Serum transaminase levels were higher with hepatitis C virus infections. Serum urea and creatinine were in the normal range (2.6 mmol/L and 1.5 mmol/L, respectively; Table ).
