Assessment: She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.

**RESPONSE:**

   Keywords:  Background: She had experienced a recent cardiac arrest. During the cardiac arrest, an unknown object lodged in the chest.  Case Report:  A 50-year-old female presented to the ED with a 5.0-cm, 8-mm, red, oval-shaped object located in the chest over a 5-minute period. Two days before the presentation, she had experienced a sudden cardiac arrest and was treated with CPR immediately after arrest. During resuscitation, she described the sudden onset of chest pain followed by the chest pain disappearing, followed by a feeling of heaviness and pressure in her chest. She recalled that she heard her baby's cries and felt cold, but she had a hard time distinguishing one object from another. In the ED, she was given an electrocardiogram, and her ventricular fibrillation was stopped. She was resuscitated with defibrillation and placed on emergency equipment. The patient developed a syncopal episode 2 hours later and was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Her chest X-ray was abnormal. She admitted that she had had a heart attack 2 hours before and that, when she was being treated, she had been in a panic attack. A CT and X-ray were performed and she was found to have a pneumothorax 2–3 cm (0.8–1.0 inch) deep in the right ventricle. The left pulmonary vein was seen in a V-shaped pattern and the right-sided renal vein was seen and palpated. There was a small amount of thrombosis in the right pulmonary vein, but no palpable clot. X-rays showed a ventricular ectopia, a small left atrial septal defect, and pulmonary hypertension. Because of the embolus, she was referred to a thoracic surgeon for a percutaneous tracheostomy and angiography as well as an angiogram of the left ventricle. She was treated with a pulmonary drug program and did not require further treatment. The patient was discharged with supportive care and the angiogram after 3 weeks.  Outcome:  The object was located and removed. The patient's left pulmonary vein was seen in a V-shaped pattern and the right-sided renal vein was seen and palpated. There was a small amount of thrombosis in the right pulmonary vein, but no palpable clot.  Conclusion:  During the resuscitation, she was unable
