PROMPT:

AP:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. 

RESPONSE:

  During a second follow-up CT scan,  The tumorous mass had shrunk by 90% and was undetectable except for a small area of necrosis.  Treatment consisted of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Following a year of medical therapy,  The patient was able to return to her job and work properly again.  The patient had initially consulted his physician about a tumorous mass that appeared during her annual physical examination.  He referred her to a gastroenterologist, who  concluded that the tumour would most likely progress or regress with physical therapy, however the patient's symptoms and personal history did not raise any suspicion for the presence of any medical conditions.  After discussing her case with her primary care physician, the patient was referred to an endocrinologist, who confirmed the previous diagnoses.  The patient was referred for a follow-up CT scan, which confirmed that the mass had gone into total ablation of the mass.  The tumor had regressed to a 2cm diameter.  The patient's physical exam was normal and her personal history did not raise any suspicion for any medical conditions.  She was treated by a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  During the course of treatment, her tumors had returned to pre-treatment levels.  The patient was given a 5-year followup CT scan with complete remission of all her neoplasms. The first patient, with a benign lump on the stomach, is the subject of the following clinical presentation: Patient 1:  The patient presented with a 7 inch mass that had appeared on her left side during a routine physical examination. The mass was about 2 inches in diameter, and contained no obvious signs of foreign bodies.  The mass was identified as a large polyp formation (at right). A review of the pathology report by the pathologist indicated that the cancer was of the carcinogen-induced type, and had spread to the liver and spleen. The patient presented with abdominal pain and bloating.  Prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient had experienced no signs of illness. Blood tests were within normal limits for her age and gender. The patient had no previous history of cancer or other medical treatments.   The patient underwent surgery to complete a "debridement" of the mass and to remove it entirely.  The operation was successful. The mass was removed without any complications. The pathology report from the pathologist is described as follows: "The
