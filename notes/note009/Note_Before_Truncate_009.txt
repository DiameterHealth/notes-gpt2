PROMPT:

Assessment & Plan:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.

RESPONSE:

  She was discharged home and admitted to hospital in a semi-conscious state, and as per the hospital records, she remained under pressure with no significant neurologic deficit.  Conclusions & Relevance:  This case demonstrates the high risk of a sudden transient ischemic stroke with associated severe neurologic deficit. Keywords: stroke, ischemic, transient, pressure, ischemia, brain, hospital  Introduction Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined as a sudden cardiac arrhythmia lasting less than 10 minutes that is characterized by: sudden episodes of shortness of breath or shortness of breath with chest discomfort; and shortness of breath or shortness of breath at rest, along with syncope and tachycardia.1 The most common subtypes of POTS include arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)2 and POTS,3 which have been called "mini-sternoylopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia syndrome."3,4 Because POTS can cause arrhythmias and heart failure, it remains the primary indication for emergency department (ED) use of β-blockers,5 although this treatment only reduces the risk of cardiac death in 1% of patients.6,7 There is an urgent need to identify and manage these rare cases in EDs to improve outcomes. This study describes a rare case of POTS that occurred in a patient with a relatively benign and mild medical event. This case highlights the clinical significance of sudden transient ischemic stroke (TTS) with ventricular fibrillation or block, and highlights the need to better define TTS and identify a target number of episodes prior to referral for angiography or in the immediate post-discharge period in patients with TTS. This case illustrates the high risk of a sudden transient ischemic stroke with severe neurologic deficit and provides evidence for monitoring of TTS, for patients with evidence of TTS, and for a careful evaluation of heart function after the rapid initiation of β-blockers.  Case Report A 35-year-old woman presented with brief chest pain and headache, was found to have mild transient ischemic stroke with ventricular fibrillation and block after falling from a chair and hitting her head. She was discharged home immediately after admission and had no major neurologic complication. The following day, she returned to the medical clinic complaining of a headache, shortness of breath, feeling dizzy
