Keywords: stroke, ischemic, transient, pressure, ischemia, brain, hospital  Introduction Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined as a sudden cardiac arrhythmia lasting less than 10 minutes that is characterized by: sudden episodes of shortness of breath or shortness of breath with chest discomfort; and shortness of breath or shortness of breath at rest, along with syncope and tachycardia.1 The most common subtypes of POTS include arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)2 and POTS,3 which have been called "mini-sternoylopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia syndrome."3,4 Because POTS can cause arrhythmias and heart failure, it remains the primary indication for emergency department (ED) use of β-blockers,5 although this treatment only reduces the risk of cardiac death in 1% of patients.6,7 There is an urgent need to identify and manage these rare cases in EDs to improve outcomes.
