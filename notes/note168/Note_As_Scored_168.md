**PROMPT:**

Assessment & Plan:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

This pregnancy was planned and she was evaluated with a c-section at 37 weeks. She did all prenatal tests and no fetal anomalies were suspected or detected. Her pregnancy was a bit more complicated and she had a small amniotic sac that developed early in labor (2 days ago). She underwent a laparotomy later the same day. I am going to make the judgment call that this was a result of her premature delivery, probably due to the amniotic sac or because of the placenta.
