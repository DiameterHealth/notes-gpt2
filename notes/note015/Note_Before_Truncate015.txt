PROMPT:

Assessment & Plan:  Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days

RESPONSE:

 . Patient may require follow-up with neurologist.  Management of complications: This patient has a mild-to-moderate form of PCP associated with a mild cerebrovascular event that the medical staff believes is not life-threatening. Although there is no evidence of significant structural damage, there has been some loss of left-side vision, decreased awareness and balance, and difficulty swallowing. The medical staff will be monitoring for additional signs and symptoms of PCP, such as increased speech, decreased balance, and loss of awareness.  Discussion:  It is estimated that approximately 20% of patients who present with focal neurologic signs and symptoms, typically resolve and only 1-3% will require hospitalization.  Management: This is a highly idiosyncratic case. Since the initial investigation, this patient has failed both the initial pharmacotherapy and the initial neurologic evaluation and the medical staff is awaiting the neurologist assessment; further follow-up with imaging is recommended. A complete neurologic evaluation was not performed for this patient due to lack of available imaging modalities. It is possible that neuropsychological testing can further elucidate this case.
