RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):

We took an ultrasound on Jan 4th and had our first appointment with her on the 5th (and a second on Jan 6th). On Jan 7th she was found to be 25 cm dilated, and the baby was 20 cm long. She was having contractions for about 5 minutes, and she had to be sedated twice to achieve a cervix that could be induced by our midwife.
