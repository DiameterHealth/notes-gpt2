**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE:**

  These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of compartment syndrome and, as such, the patient is considered to be suffering from bilateral hip osteoarthritis and required urgent surgical intervention. Under medical decision making, a bilateral hip osteoarthritis was considered to be the appropriate treatment decision for the patient. Further evaluation of the case revealed that the patient had a history of multiple prior surgical treatment attempts (including osteotomy, open arthrosurgery, and corticosteroid injections) for bilateral hip bone deformities. Treatment had included a combination of osteotomectomy and surgical grafts to the anterior compartment. Due to the patient's history of prior surgery, initial treatment with corticosteroid injection was considered to be inappropriate based on the patient's history and clinical examination. There were no additional surgical treatment indications. Based on the available literature, it was ruled out that a concurrent injury, such as a sports injury, would have caused the observed clinical presentation. However, it was considered unlikely that the patient would have undergone surgery at the time of presentation because of his well-controlled pain, lack of complications, and his good long-term prognosis from the initial diagnosis.  Case Report: A 50-year-old male with a history of four prior hip arthroscopic surgeries was found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abductor dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis on chest radiographs. There was a history of multiple previous orthopedic surgical treatments (orthotomectomy, arthroscopy, and corticosteroid injections) that had been either unsuccessful or limited in the amount of pain relief. The patient was considered to be suffering from bilateral hip osteoarthritis and required urgent surgical intervention. A unilateral knee scope was applied with no apparent complication. The patient underwent total hip arthroscopy and was found to have bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes. A bilateral hip osteoarthritis (BRA) was ruled out and a bilateral left biceps femoris (BFF) tendonectomy performed. Further evaluations revealed that the patient was experiencing symptoms of joint pain, severe dyspareunia, and right lower quadral pain during daily activities. This patient was found to have BFF tendon damage. After treatment with a BFF arthroscopy with an arthroscope, the patient was found to have patella dislocation with bone degeneration, osteoarthritic involvement, and calcification of the synovium
