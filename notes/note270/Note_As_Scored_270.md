**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of compartment syndrome and, as such, the patient is considered to be suffering from bilateral hip osteoarthritis and required urgent surgical intervention. Under medical decision making, a bilateral hip osteoarthritis was considered to be the appropriate treatment decision for the patient. Further evaluation of the case revealed that the patient had a history of multiple prior surgical treatment attempts (including osteotomy, open arthrosurgery, and corticosteroid injections) for bilateral hip bone deformities.
