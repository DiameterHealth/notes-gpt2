**PROMPT:**

HPI Patient has concerns including Rash. Itchy rash started yesterday AM on face. Was red, faded, then more red and tender in afternoon. Took benadryl once yesterday with history of no new food or products

**RESPONSE (Sentence ending after 60th word):**

since last 2 days. My doctor is concerned about this, not about the itching or rash, but the history of food etc. He suggested the cream and I plan to try. Is it necessary though? I am not trying to cause trouble, just want the right cream for my skin. I know its not as simple as one says, but I want to know if that is the answer.
