 .  Case Number: 17-02582  Date: 05/01/2013  Location: Dallas, TX, USA  Case Characteristics: The patient was a 36 yr old black female, who presented to the ED complaining of abdominal pain and nausea that was being relieved by gastric tube placement at the time of presentation. There were no underlying medical conditions known at the time of presentation (pulmonary emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure). The abdominal complaint was suggestive of appendicitis, so the patient's stomach was examined. An abdominal aortic root catheter was inserted. Upon palpation, the contents of the right upper part of the right stomach were aspirated. The patient was admitted with symptoms of nausea, abdominal pain, and weakness.  Investigation: The patient was given an indwelling venous catheter for catheterisation. An ultrasound demonstrated a right lower lobe pericardial sac abscess, with perforation of the right upper lobe that extended into the left upper lobe. Blood and fluid draining from the catheter was collected and transferred from the right upper lobe into the left upper lobe via a catheter placed in the lower abdomen. The patient's abdomen was opened and the contents of the bowel were examined. Blood and bowel fluid was aspirated and collected. The stomach contents were removed in a similar manner to the patient's upper abdominal contents. The bowel contents revealed multiple appendicitis-like growths with various sizes and shapes. Two large lesions within the upper right portion of the right lower lobe were identified, the other two smaller lesions were situated on the inside of the right side in the same position as the larger lesions.  Management: The patient was put on antibiotics for 6 weeks, and after the last dose of the antibiotics she was advised of anti-inflammatory and antibacterial prescriptions to reduce the risk of recurrence. The patient's symptoms resolved in approximately 2 weeks, her abdomen was opened and she was placed on an endoscopic port. She was treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy, and 2 weeks later began gastric tube placement. On 1/3/2014 a small growth was found in the right upper lobe that was treated with a small section of surgical skin graft (SIG). The patient remained in the hospital on endoscopic control for approximately 22 months after diagnosis.  Conclusion: Patient did not develop a perforated pericardial sac, although significant abscesses occurred in the right lower lobe of the right
