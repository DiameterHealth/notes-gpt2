   Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.  PURPOSE: We did a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of nafarelin in improving symptoms related to irritable bowel syndrome in children and adolescents.  METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and CENTRAL, up to 23 Nov 2013. The following criteria were used to define relevant RCTs: randomised controlled trials with nafarelin compared with placebo as the intervention or placebo as the control; study duration of at least 4 weeks; children and adolescents of all ages; patients with symptomatic IBS.  RESULTS: We analysed 17 RCTs, which had a total of 1,842 participants, resulting in a large majority of studies (n = 11). There were no RCTs assessing the effect of placebo or no treatment as a control. All study designs (RCTs, intervention trials, crossover trials with treatment-as-usual) were found to show positive findings for nafarelin. No studies reported any serious adverse events. The authors report that, in children and adolescents with symptomatic IBS, symptoms of IBS resolved better and were less severe with administration of nafarelin.  CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive evidence indicates nafarelin is safe and effective in improving the symptoms related to irritable bowel syndrome in children and adolescents. This is particularly relevant at a time when the use of antidepressants is increasing, increasing the risk that IBS will be misdiagnosed, untreated or undertreated.
