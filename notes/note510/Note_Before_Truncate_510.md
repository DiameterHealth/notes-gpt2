  for 10 days. Patient was not on any medications.  TREATMENT/OTHER OUTLINE Treatment: Tretinoin: 0.3% + 0.5% topical retinoids (tretinoin 1% cream, Tretinoin gel 0.05% gel, or Tretinoin 0.025% gel) for 4 weeks; or Tretinoin 0.05% cream, gel, or 0.025% cream only for 6 weeks. Patient was on topical retinoids 1 to 3 times daily. Eye: At first, patient was not concerned about eye inflammation associated with the antibiotic so it was treated without the eye rashes.  After 3 or 4 weeks, eye irritation resolved, and after 1 month, treatment was stopped as it was not considered to be a problem.  At 2 months, patient had been using topical retinoids daily, and only twice a week or so at that point.  At 5 months, patient had been using topical retinoids for 1 month, used topical retinoid cream for 3 months, and was using topical retinoid gel for 4 months. Patient received Tretinoin cream on first use, and on the fourth and 5th months, he started using Tretinoin gel 0.025%.  After 1 month, Tretinoin 0.25% gel was applied once, and then again in monthly intervals. After one year, Tretinoin 0.025% cream was applied twice weekly for four visits per year. In case of eye irritation, topical tretinoin 0.025% cream was applied first and then applied Tretinoin gel 0.025%.  Tretinoin cream is available with 0.05% to 1% strength. 0.05% is stronger than 0.1%, and the 0.05% is the strength that is used in this case. Patients are responsible for compliance with daily application of the 0.025%.  Results: The patient did well at 1 month and 3 months. At 6 months, tretinoin gel was used every other day in the morning and evening for the past three months so tretinoin was used as a daily topical application.  Tretinoin tretinoin gel 0.025% cream 0.04% is not available in the US.  Tretinoin 0.05% cream  0.1 is more likely to cause eye irritation but does
