[30]  ) (The most commonly prescribed H2 antagonists). In most cases, an H2 antagonist can be administered after the 3rd round of treatment. Antihistamines (Halofantrine HCl) : There have been a few studies that suggest that antihistaminic agents may help delay postoperative recurrence of urinary tract infection. [32, 33]  Clinically useful doses of H2 antagonists, H1 antagonists and/or H3 antagonists for urinary tract infection include 30 mg/day, 60 mg/day, 80 mg/day and 120 mg/day. [34, 35] A study was published in 2006 involving a dose range of 60 mg/day and 160 mg/day of haloperidol. It was found that in terms of reduction in symptoms, all three agents had the most benefit while haloperidol (40 mg/day) and diazepam (60 mg/day) were less effective than haloperidol. [36]  Anti-Inflammatory Agents for UTI: There are a few studies that suggest a possible benefit of antiinflammatory agents in reducing the incidence of recurrence or exacerbation with urinary tract infections [37]. There are several possible reasons for such a benefit. It is possible that the inflammatory reactions from acute infections (as opposed to chronic infections) can enhance the efficacy of antiinflammatory agents. Another reason could be that a chronic infection may be responsible for the immune system's abnormal activation.  One possible study involved the effects of ibuprofen (AdvilÂ®) on the clinical course of a chronic urinary tract infection. It compared the efficacy of ibuprofen versus placebo in reducing the incidence of recurrence within 24 hours by day 5. The authors reported that the efficacy of ibuprofen versus placebo decreased progressively by day 5 (9.6% vs. 32% vs. 15% reduction in recurrence incidence). [38]  A study was designed to compare the therapeutic effects of oral NSAIDs and their respective decongestants in patients with short-term UTI (up to 1 day in duration) in a high-risk population. The authors noted that the decongestants (dicyclomine hydrochloride, desmopress
