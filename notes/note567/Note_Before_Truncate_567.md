**PROMPT:**

History of Present Illness This is a 72-year-old male with history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft

**RESPONSE:**

 . He is hypertensive, dyslipidemic, diabetic. History of prior bypass graft, previous heart transplantation, and prior use of insulin or insulin pump.  Present Illness History of hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with history of bypass graft, history of prior coronary artery bypass graft, use of HRT, treatment with metformin or pioglitazone.  Affected Areas Cardiovascular System: Renal dysfunction and edema, left ventricular hypertrophy and infarction.  Respiratory: Expiratory mucosal injury, pneumonia, sinusitis, wheezing, dyspnoea.  Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal mucosal injury, nausea, vomiting, gastroenteritis.  Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, myalgia, tingling, paresthesias, pain  Psychological: Suicidal ideation, self-harm, depression  Dermatologic: Acne vulgaris.  Other: Increased risk of infection, viral and bacterial infections, allergic reactions, hypercalcemia, and systemic infections and toxemia (particularly of non-cardial origin in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus)  Complications of MI This cardiologist believes that the patient's heart is being starved of oxygen; is in a state of shock due to hypoxemia; is failing to achieve adequate perfusion of the circulatory system with its increased workload and increased oxygen needs; is exhibiting a pattern of dysfunctions as outlined by the above disease history; and that it will become obvious over several hours that other organs and systems are not receiving adequate perfusion from this heart.  What are the risks of reperfusion stroke? This cardiologist believes that the risk of severe stroke will increase rapidly during reperfusion with a consequent need for emergent intubation. It is critical that the patient be able to demonstrate cardiac tamponade and a marked blood loss immediately prior to the arrival of medical personnel. A history of previous cardiac tamponade or history of pericarditis is a strong predictor of increased stroke risk. Therefore, rapid coronary vasospasm will likely result in a sudden onset of bradycardia and tachycardia which will further increase stroke risk. A history of previous heart transplant surgery, particularly aspergillosis/brucellosis, should be considered when assessing
