EXAMPLES OF HYPOCENTERMAL REFERENCE PATIENTS Hypertension  (and related disorders)  The term is derived from an 1887 paper by Dr. William Davis, who noted there were 20 known cases of hypertensive references, in which one or more of 13 common variables were present. Hypertension refers to any of a number of conditions linked to increased blood pressure. Those factors are not all the same, however, and in the absence of clear evidence, a clinical diagnosis is still based on the most common, most consistent and best-supported variables. When a patient develops hypertension, he should also have an examination and measurement of his major risk factors, his medical history, and any other factors that have been conclusively linked to increased blood pressure. These factors include, but are not limited to, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, and stress.   Excessive alcohol consumption is a leading risk factor for hypertension. This relationship also exists between overweight and hypertension.   Smoking. The combination of physical inactivity and increased consumption of tobacco are major risk factors for hypertension. Hypertension is a consequence of an imbalance between the blood vessels that supply blood to the body and arteries that drain blood away from tissues such as the skin and joints. This imbalance increases the risk for vascular diseases.   Obesity. Obesity affects the heart and skeletal muscles so that the body loses or may have lost the normal amount of fat. This can increase blood pressure.   Sleep Apnea. Some older individuals with sleep apnea, called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), may develop hypertension. This condition, which involves a person who stops breathing repeatedly, can be corrected by an obstructive sleep apnea treatment that helps relax the muscles of the airway. Hypertension can sometimes be brought under control with medication, which helps increase blood pressure, among other things.   Age. The greater the age, the greater the risk of hypertension. A study showed that blood pressure increased by nearly seven points (one and a half) for every two-inch increment in age (from age 80 to 85 to 85 to 86--up to 10 points).   Exercise. Even mild physical activity can affect blood pressure. A 2010 study in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that high blood pressure increased significantly only after moderate to vigorous exercise.
