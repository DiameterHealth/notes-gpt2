**PROMPT:**

Medical Decision Making: Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

**RESPONSE:**

  Medical decision making: Patient is a 20 y.o. with heart failure due to pericarditis.  Medical decision making: Patient presents after fainting in the evening with abnormal ECG pattern consistent with atrial fibrillation.  Medical decision making: Patient is a 34 y.o. with history of heart failure and pulmonary embolism.  Medical decision making: Patient is a 38 y.o. with history of acute myocardial infarction.  Medical decision making: Patient presents after fainting with abnormal ECG pattern consistent with atrial fibrillation.   "Medical decision making" doesn't get much greater than ECG analysis. This is how we got into a lot of our current mess.  As you can see, the problem is a lot bigger than just the individual tests that we now perform upon the patient. The problem is much more complex... I've touched upon this in my book "Dr. Jeffery Pert: Making the Case for Modern American Medicine" as a whole, but the key problem is the patient's experience, and most of it is simply due to not teaching them the necessary skills to make these kinds of decisions.   I have no doubt that you can be very good with medical decision making, but there are very few people who can actually make decisions in a way that they can really help their patients. The problem is, at present, this has been lost in translation.  Doctors simply don't use the same set of rules for medical decision making when making decisions in clinical practice -- especially about how to evaluate the data coming from their instruments.  This translates into the patient being thrown to the wolves, without understanding whether they are at risk from something more dangerous, or a complication that is not due to the procedure, and doesn't need to be corrected with the medicine that they have already been given by the doctor.  And of course, the patient is not given the time to take his or her own personal history, much less take the time to get proper test results. So, what can we change to make the practice of medicine more patient-centered? I agree with one thing that you say very clearly, and which I have to admit I never got before.  You say, "Patients are more patient-centered than professionals".   Yes, they are more patient-centered than professionals.  They are more patient-centered in two areas. First, they are more patient
