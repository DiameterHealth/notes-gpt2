, with an admission cardiac index of less than 3. Diagnostic Criteria: T-wave, STEMI, Q-wave, P-wave, PR interval (all <3 sec), echogenic mitral regurgitation  Initiated Treatment & Outcome: Successful percutaneous coronary intervention  Initial Implantation:   7.6 cm  0 months after implantation, the Q wave was reduced to P-wave  2 months after implantation, there was good P-wave progression and a decrease in the Q wave  Outcome: Good  Outcome: No change  Parsons (2003-2008)  Background: This is an example of a patient with PCHI who died with myocardial infarction (MI) after myocardial revascularization  Patients: A 42 year old female with no prior history of myocardial disease; age 55 years  Primary end point: Recurrence of MI  Outcome: No recurrence of MI  Conclusion: The patient was followed up after MI recurrence, and a subsequent post-MI follow-up showed her without evidence of PCHI recurrence or death  Diagnostic Criteria: Q wave abnormalities >3 mm VQ  Disease State = Myocardial infarction with or without angiography  Initiated Treatment / Outcome:  No treatment  Secondary end point: Changes in Q waves during the first year of follow-up  Diagnostic Criteria: Progressive Q waves  Disease State = Angina Pectoris with or without a PQ-wave in 1/2 of the second half of the Q-wave  Initiated Treatment / Outcome: No treatment  Secondary end point:  No treatment  Cullberg (2010)  Background: Patients were treated with PCI; most were older (>60-79) women who had myocardial infarction with revascularization.
