Assessment & Plan:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%She was discharged home and admitted to hospital in a semi-conscious state, and as per the hospital records, she remained under pressure with no significant neurologic deficit. Conclusions & Relevance:  This case demonstrates the high risk of a sudden transient ischemic stroke with associated severe neurologic deficit. Keywords: stroke, ischemic, transient, pressure, ischemia, brain, hospital  Introduction Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined as a sudden cardiac arrhythmia lasting less than 10 minutes that is characterized by: sudden episodes of shortness of breath or shortness of breath with chest discomfort; and shortness of breath or shortness of breath at rest, along with syncope and tachycardia.1 The most common subtypes of POTS include arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)2 and POTS,3 which have been called "mini-sternoylopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia syndrome."3,4 Because POTS can cause arrhythmias and heart failure, it remains the primary indication for emergency department (ED) use of β-blockers,5 although this treatment only reduces the risk of cardiac death in 1% of patients.6,7 There is an urgent need to identify and manage these rare cases in EDs to improve outcomes. 
Assessment & Plan:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.^%^%^%The fetus had been delivered earlier on Jan 1st with the midwife having indicated pre-term labor and a positive pregnancy test. The baby girl had a low gestational age at birth of 41 weeks and 8 days and was the 2nd of two girls. Procedure:  The uterus was divided into two chambers. One was an abdominal aorta from 7 cm to 11 cm in diameter and was divided in half. 
Assessment & Plan:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction^%^%^%.  Management:  Initiate conservative management for hypotension and dehydration and initiate a 3rd IV line 1 hour post induction with 5.24mm in the right lower lobe. Radiographic Findings:  Cardiac troponin, 8.8ng/ml  Auscultation, 120s  Treatment:  Immediately initiate therapy with the following options:  1. IV nitroglycerine  2. Intravenous fluids (60% 1L Nolvasan/10% NPH O2, 1.5 L saline)  3. 
Assessment & Plan:  The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care^%^%^%allergist. Preliminary:  The patient had been given a complete physical exam with skin prp. No significant findings were noted but she had had a recent cold. She also was given a complete physical exam with skin prp. An allergic reaction to a patch test showed a positive patch test with mite testing and positive blood tests. Her skin prp and blood tests had shown she does not have skin allergies. 
Assessment & Plan:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.^%^%^%After thorough evaluation and treatment including lateral and transverse cephalad-sutures and bilateral epidural steroid injections in conjunction with bilateral hip arthroplasty and transdermal calcibat implants, the patient is discharged to home in great hopes of long-term recovery. The patient's hip strength improves to the point that it is no longer required for weightbearing at work in which her back pain does not exist, a small reduction in her left femur length is noted between initial and follow-up. 
Assessment & Plan:  Routine discharge to nursing home is scheduled for this afternoon. Patient should continue with physical and occupationsl therapy to regain strength^%^%^%& mobility. Physical activity and occupational therapy will be done as needed until discharged. It was noted that the patient suffered complications with his knee due to surgery 2 years ago & has ongoing post-surgery pain. TREATMENT: The patient is recovering and walking without assistance. The patient was in fair condition at the time of discharge. It was determined that the patient did not need surgery.

Management of complications: This patient has a mild-to-moderate form of PCP associated with a mild cerebrovascular event that the medical staff believes is not life-threatening. Although there is no evidence of significant structural damage, there has been some loss of left-side vision, decreased awareness and balance, and difficulty swallowing. 
Assessment & Plan:  Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications^%^%^%; and   Management Plan:  Patient was advised of medications and ongoing surveillance and has discussed them with attending physician but plans to follow medications as they are updated; and Patient was advised that the next scheduled visit is at 2:00 p.m. 
Assessment & Plan:  The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^%.  Management of Infected Cat:  1) All cats will have to be isolated from other cats for 48 hrs post treatment – if not managed early enough in the episode, infection can be highly severe and lead to permanent ulcerative skin lesions. 2) All cat will need to be checked for any new infections and their current vaccinations. Treatment of Ulcer:  All of the above needs to be kept a constant constant watch for infections and/or signs of skin irritation. 
Assessment & Plan:  Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%and follow any instructions by your specialist. Dietary Restrictions: Take only water-containing beverages to avoid dehydration; if you are pregnant, please consult your clinician prior to taking or discontinuing the drug.

Assessment & Plan:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%The patient's weight stabilized with careful management of the patient's appetite and hydration by the treating medical staff. The patient underwent an oral nutritional assessment to ensure a sustained improvement in body weight, and the patient's weight normalized at 5 months post-treatment. Post-treatment clinical course On physical examination, the patient was found to have moderate, but persistent, aldosterone deficiency that persisted despite regular weight gain. 
Assessment & Plan:  Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%or one year. Follow-up in 11/12 year after diagnosis. Management and Outcome for this Population:  Not Applicable. Post-transfusion Hemorrhage  Hemorrhagic stroke is the most common serious stroke during anticoagulation therapy and occurs when the bleeding is interrupted during blood coagulation. The risk of hemorrhage from any anticoagulation therapy is increased in patients with significant bleeding. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs most commonly in patients with previous hemorrhage and when the bleeding occurs during a time of the day or when the patient is not in an upright position. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks^%^%^%to discuss his progress. One week after the completion of his first course of antibiotics, the patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks to discuss his progress. Conclusion:  The patient is monitored for an extended period of time during initial administration of antibiotics, in hopes of getting this condition under control. The physician is then advised to administer a second dose of antibiotics on a different day. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and ^%^%^%is being treated at home with oxygen and pain relief until discharge." Pt will be discharged by Wednesday and the family has no other plans for him because he was not required in hospital, Ms Gannon said. She said their plan was to bring him back to the UK to live with them. They were also in touch with the Department of Immigration to obtain Mr Bikubi's visa so he could be reunited with his family at school. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist^%^%^%. Physical findings suggest respiratory involvement or lung injury. The pulmonary assessment may be a good option for the patient with a history of obstructive pulmonary disease. A diagnosis of pulmonary edema may be helpful in determining a good course of treatment. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection^%^%^%. The patient will be retested 6-8 weeks later to see if there were signs of infection in the urine, an indication for the continued use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or if the infection resolved itself, but the patient will need to be retested after 8 weeks to ensure this is not a recurrence of infection. Management of Urethritis, Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) and Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) in Men with BPH:  Medscape Medical News provides a complete overview of urethritis and urinary tract infections in men with BPH. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.^%^%^%Should the fever resolve or the patient not be able to stand, the patient should be able to rest comfortably. Encephalopathy: Should the patient have neurological deficits the medical consultant should be contacted urgently. Management:  The medical consultant should identify the source of these infections and advise the patient of the most appropriate course of action. An encephalopathie is not a single entity, so it is important that the patient receive a thorough assessment from a medical consultant. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension ^%^%^%was followed by a successful TAVI. Treatment of STS and BH is controversial. We believe that the treatment of STS in patients with BH who fail treatment of a GAD has potential value. The treatment of  BH in patients with TAVI is currently debated in the literature but more study is needed to confirm this. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. ^%^%^%He has also had significant weight loss and hyponatremia. The patient has not had an evaluation in the past 6 months. He denies overtreatment of medications. The evaluation of other patients with atrial fibrillation has been minimal, but the current patient does not fit the exclusionary criteria for arrhythmogenic atrial fibrillation. Discussion:   The presentation and history of the patient are quite bizarre. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient should follow up within 2 days and continue medications as prescribed^%^%^%.  Summary:    A woman's risk of developing breast cancer can be reduced by taking a daily multivitamin, and even more when there is an additional benefit. The best way to take this is by taking a multivitamin that includes the mineral DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). 
Assessment & Recommendation:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%She continued to take aspirin and metronidazole but experienced significant pain later in the day when driving. She resumed aspirin and metronidazole but experienced some additional pain in the morning when driving. She has now stopped taking aspirin and metronidazole although the pain was still moderate. There will be future studies to determine how the body responds to low-dose aspirin/metronidazole with the same or different analgesics, and if more pain can be managed with a higher dose (eg, 325 mg of aspirin/metronidazole). 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.^%^%^%Innovative management:  The patient was managed within her institutional setting in the most efficient way possible. The fetus was delivered at term in a breech presentation. Conclusion:  Our experience suggests the use of a cedric clamp, similar to that used in many other settings outside the United States, should be considered. References: (2, 4, 5)  1. Tuck, S. F. (2009). "Tuck Technique in the Emergency Department." 
Assessment & Recommendation:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction^%^%^%. Patient presents with acute acute MI. His blood work is in normal ranges with an eGFR under 50 (normal is 80). He had significant pulmonary impairment and his blood pressure was 70/25. Outcome:  Good. Comments:  I will refer patients with prior myocardial infarction to this protocol with this interpretation. Routes:  CXR. 3. The following are examples of scenarios that may be encountered but it is not intended to be exhaustive. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care^%^%^%provider for routine blood test. Management: This patient was seen for allergy testing and had the following laboratory results documented. No evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other underlying conditions. She is in excellent health with a history of asthma, but no history of asthma exacerbations within the past year. The patient had not been on any medication for 4 months. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.^%^%^%The patient is referred to the orthopaedic surgeon. The orthopaedic surgeon will carefully diagnose the diagnosis which is a combination of patella dislocation and degenerative changes in both hips. The surgical procedure will be divided into an emergency intervention and a planned follow-up. Discussion:  The patient who did not have a history of hip fracture prior to a previous hip replacement procedure due to a complete rupture of the calcified synovium within 10 weeks of the previous hip fracture will develop anterior compartment syndrome in the second attempt [1]. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Routine discharge to nursing home is scheduled for this afternoon. Patient should continue with physical and occupationsl therapy to regain strength^%^%^%.  Postoperative Care:  Routine blood work. Outcome: Discharged after 2 weeks; no further complications. Outcome Measures: Normal physical and occupational status. Results:   A single 1-mg capsule of Laminaria japonica leaf extract had no effect on bleeding or other complications during this procedure. Discussion:  This study suggests another treatment option for hemorrhagic peptic ulcers that is more potent than the other available therapies. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days^%^%^%.  Implementation:  Contact the physician who did the initial review of the case and make arrangements to resume the therapy at home as needed. Outcome:  Patient remains free of recurrence. Notes:  Complications to the procedure were considered with the use of a standard protocol, which includes blood cultures and a complete medical and laboratory profile including HLA testing for both patient and her partner. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications^%^%^%. Patient was also counselled regarding her level of emotional distress. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the change in score from baseline after 6 months, followed by the change from baseline during the follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures included the Psychotic Disorders Interview Schedule-Revised (PDI-R), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF-S), and global quality of life assessment of global functioning, global depression scale, and global anxiety scale. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^% . 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%and monitor for signs of intolerance to food. Continue medications containing beta-blockers. If any side effects occur, stop them immediately and stop using the product. If intolerance persist, consult cardiologist. Treatment & Prevention:  Treatment of ankyloglossia: If the condition is severe (<2 mmHg > 5 h per week in the past 90 d) or does not respond to previous treatment:  Treatment for ankyloglossia can include a combination of medications depending on severity of the condition. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%Report to Physician:  Patient was advised that her breasts were "normal weight" with an average circumference of 32C. She asked her gynecologist if more breast growth was expected. The gynecologist told her that although there were no obvious changes to the patient's "breasts", there could be breast cysts and increased breast growth, with potential for cysts to grow at an increased rate. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%, then every 3 months thereafter until resolution or discontinuance of the medication. Treatment:  Avoidance during active illness, for at least 7 days. Outcome:   Medication was taken at a reduced dose, in the hope that the infection would recur  Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, headache  Patient 1 ******** N/A  1.0 Initial Assessment:  Erythema multiforme of the mouth, tongue and/or throat, with nausea and vomiting. 
Assessment / Plan: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks^%^%^%and will be seen in the ED with discharge from the hospital. Died: On day 26 of hospitalization. Interventions / Results: The patient was discharged from hospital on day 28 and his medication was discontinued at discharge. Conclusion / Comment:  This is a case report of an otherwise well matched bipolar with a diagnosis of bipolar type II. There were several risk factors that led to hospitalization, including prior suicide attempts, a history of psychotic episodes requiring hospitalization within the prior 6 months, and poor adherence to medication. 
Assessment / Plan: Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and ^%^%^%urns. She will return to recovery at home on Thursday, Jan. 25. The diagnosis has been made and the decision was made for her to be discharged. Recovery: She will be recovering with a support network. She will not return to any regular activity for another 7 to 10 days. A discharge schedule has not been set yet. Preventive health: Dr. 
Assessment / Plan: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist^%^%^%. The patient requires intermittent or continuous, or non-intravenous, nitroglycerin with IV nitroglycerin infusion, or IV nitroglycerin infusion only during clinical crises or severe asthma attacks. The following patients were excluded from the study: patients with acute lung injury, the need for mechanical ventilation; patients with severe lung disease, diabetes, or the need for continuous IV nitroglycerin for hypoglycemia (defined as an oral glucose/glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin > 7%); patients with chronic heart failure; and patients who were already receiving inhaled glucagon (4). 
Assessment / Plan: Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection^%^%^%Outcome: Patient was discharged home with a low level of bladder symptoms  Conclusion: Antibiotics may help reduce post-discharge bladder pain and symptoms.

Conclusion: Estradiol 100 mg every 2 hours will not be effective against acute UTI in women with previous high-grade precancerous lesions. Key Points:  Low-grade carcinomas rarely progress and/or persist. 
Assessment: Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.^%^%^%Management: A rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of the underlying cause is important. The treatment of the underlying cause may be required. A diagnosis, evaluation and management of the underlying cause (eg. infection) is the starting point for the treatment of the associated pathophysiology. Diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis  When the clinical history of acute pyelonephritis is available, the clinician should perform a complete physical examination (Table). 
Assessment: Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension ^%^%^%150/100 mmHg, dyslipidemia, and renal insufficiency was initiated. The patient was discharged to home after 2 days of maintenance therapy with clopidogrel, aspirin, and lamotrigine for dyslipidemia. Background:  Previous studies show that the risk of thrombotic and thrombotic nonfatal cardiovascular events associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs varies with the degree of initial hypertension, which may be increased by concurrent drug therapy or concomitant use of antiplatelets and antithrombotic agents. 
Assessment: Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. ^%^%^%An exercise stress test results in a negative response. During subsequent follow-up, he develops a left tachypnea despite being in good health. He is treated for a pulmonary embolism.

Assessment: The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^%. Pt was advised that the wound would require a 6 hour time on site visit by a medical physician. The wound was treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotic prophylaxis. Treatment involved debridement and the treatment with antibiotics (ceftriaxone, minocycline sodium, streptomycin, and gentamicin) and oral povidone 0.25% ointment. In the following days, Pt's wound was red and swollen. 
Assessment: Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%until at least day 3. Imaging  Do not perform CT scans unless imaging shows severe trauma, head injury or increased intracranial pressure. Do not have head CT scans during initial evaluation or post-concussion evaluation unless imaging indicates intracranial hemorrhage. Imaging should be repeated within 24 to 72 hours of a head CT scan for possible bleeding or skull fracture. 
Assessment: After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%[EVIDENCY] ------------ As a matter of interest: "In a review of 12 studies that evaluated the effect of TNF-α alpha, the majority of these studies showed a reduced incidence of metastatic cancer when treatment with TGF-β1 was added to standard therapy." 
Assessment: Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%Clinical and laboratory findings: No treatment response  Meaning: This randomized controlled trial found no benefit of acupuncture in improving symptoms of low back pain. Authors' conclusions: "The lack of pain relief provided by acupuncture in this study does not support its widespread use as an adjunct treatment to standard nonsurgical low back pain treatments."  N Engl J Med 2002;346:1105-1112. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks^%^%^%. The patient is nervous. He has had a recent history of aggressive behavior and his behavior is escalating. The PCP, with a sigh, informs the patient that there won't be enough time to explain everything. He has to make a decision. If the patient tells the nurse immediately, it might be a case of "he went away." If the patient waits until later in the day, it may be "he is on his own at the moment." The patient says nothing, and when the nurse asks him what is the situation, he says, "I don't know what to do, it's just awful right now." The nurse has no answers for him; it's a case for a follow-up appointment. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and ^%^%^%erythromycin. He also received additional treatment in the hospital and then has flown home. The team is grateful for the incredible support all around the world from friends and family that have been watching his fight for life, and to his doctors of Mayo.

Medical Decision Making (MDM): The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist^%^%^%at least annually. Patients with a history of stroke or ischemic attack often undergo invasive cardiac CT scans or angiograms to diagnose the cause of the bleeding, but for the patient who has chronic obstructive disease, the CT scan results are useless as an initial indication of future bleed on a follow-up visit. The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist at least annually. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection^%^%^%due to chronic prostatitis. If there is evidence of a urinary tract infection, an exploratory diagnostic procedure is recommended, including the following:  • Ultrasonography: This is the earliest imaging modality to be performed because of the presence of bacteria, particularly those that can grow on ultrasonic film. CT and MRI are also common at this time for further imaging of the kidneys and bladder; however, most patients do not require these imaging modalities for the purpose of obtaining imaging for treatment and diagnosis. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.^%^%^%Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.

Laboratory Values: HR of 65, BP of 130/80, HR of 130/80 and a normal PEEP of 5mm Hg. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%for several weeks, especially if heart attack risk is present. Consider other types of cardiac testing; e.g., echocardiography and exercise stress test. Prevention:  A high LDL cholesterol level may be considered independent of risk factors for heart failure as a whole as this is not thought to be related to the presence of myocardial inflammation. The relationship with myocardial immune dysfunction is still unclear, however, as studies indicate the level is low in many patients with myocardial infarction, despite the presence of the inflammatory markers of the myocardium (11-13). 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%Patient was observed for an average time of four days.

At auscultation, there was an extremely shallow, left-to-right T wave in the lateral inferior oblique, with a peak amplitude of ~3mm. 
AP:  Patient should follow up within 2 days and continue medications as prescribed^%^%^%, but a decrease of medication dosage may be indicated if the symptoms persist. What Should I Take When My Veterinarian May Recommend Other Medications  Patients should follow the recommendations made by their veterinarian. Consult your veterinarian for further information regarding possible medication adjustments. 
AP:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%I am told she has a low chance of a re-hospitalization as she also has a pacemaker but she does have mild left lateral subdural hematoma and is in stable condition. The MRI is not available at this time. PANTHER: A 5-year-old patient with an aortic dissection and a mild hematoma has been stabilized on mechanical ventilation with a portable pump.

Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.^%^%^%Her water breaking from the vagina on the 2:30 am feed. JAM: 2:40am - I went for an IV in the OB with the patient in labor. The next feeding would be at 6:14am . JAM: 7:00am - I took her in my arms again. This time I would be taking her on her last feeding, so her water would continue to break. 
AP:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction^%^%^%and is on high risk aspirin. The cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol is being discussed as he has been stabilized with the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. Is the patient still compatible with the machine and would it be desirable if a chest x-ray were taken prior to the initiation of therapy? Or, would the patient be better off with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alone, or would a noninvasive way of measuring airway pressure be an acceptable option? 
AP:  The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care^%^%^%staff. DIAGNOSIS:  Acute rhinitis caused by nonprescription medication with possible drug interaction (e.g., antihistamines, over the counter medications)  OR  An acute allergic reaction to medication that was not prescribed (e.g., an over-the-counter medication, medication that is not prescribed in a prescription, or medication that is taken for unknown reasons), although some may be provoked by other people.

Laboratory results were normal and no co-morbidities were noted  NHLBI-H2-13-01256: An initial blood culture, culture from the right upper arm, and culture from his left upper arm (see above), and a second blood culture, culture of the left lower leg, and culture of the right upper leg were negative for MRSA, Staphylococcus, or Streptococcal species  NHLBI-H2-13-01281:  Patient was diagnosed with a severe MRSA infection. 
AP:  The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^%.  VAGINAL HAEMORRHOID:  Patient was not monitored at all during her entire hospitalization. She did not receive the standard of care vaginal douching. It may be that the severity in her condition was not as severe, thus making it more difficult for her to urinate. The patient's case is an example of why vaginal douching and other forms of female genital mutilation are not acceptable. 
AP:  Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%(even a high dose aspirin may be needed) while you are adjusting. A doctor may want you to take an aspirin twice daily or three times a day, depending on the severity of the problem. ORTHOID:  Take this medicine on the same days you take any medicine called cyclosporine (which is made in pigs, chickens, and horses), or on the day it is prescribed (this usually takes a couple of days).

Plan of Treatment:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. ^%^%^%He continues to have severe pain with a large heart rate that is in a rhythm of T-waves and R-waves and cannot be managed on medication that has not been shown to affect the arrhythmia at all. He is considered at death's door due to lack of response to current treatment. Any advice given on the internet is based on his history and it is unlikely that he would have come in for care after seeking outside treatment. 
Plan of Treatment:  Patient should follow up within 2 days and continue medications as prescribed^%^%^%.  If symptoms occur, this should be treated immediately, but any  adherence to therapy should be monitored. 
Plan of Treatment:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%Subsequently, she experienced moderate transient ischemia after returning home from the hospital. The patient was placed on antibiotics, a 5/4 day course of prednisone and aspirin (10 /400 mg) with oral prednisone 100 mg daily. The duration of ischemic stroke was 14 hours post-concussive injury. Subsequently, the patient recovered spontaneously. She was discharged in the evening after 7 days of aggressive antibiotics, prednisone and aspirin with oral prednisone 100 mg daily.

A complete evaluation was performed. There was no history of chronic illness, medical history, or family history consistent with an allergy to eggs. There was only mild, mild asthma. The physician ordered an allergen screen to see if any previous or current allergies to eggs were present. There was no allergy. The physician concluded there was no contraindication. The patient's physician requested a repeat oropharyngeal examination of the patient after one year for additional allergy evaluation. 
Plan of Treatment:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.^%^%^%A surgical treatment should be undertaken. The patient was found to have an aortic dissection due to a tear in the aortic arch. The procedure to repair the aortic arch was performed through the pericardium, and a small, open incision was made in the aorta. The aortic dissection was repaired by reattaching the aortic arch with the use of arthroscopic suture. 
Plan of Treatment:  Routine discharge to nursing home is scheduled for this afternoon. Patient should continue with physical and occupationsl therapy to regain strength^%^%^%and energy. Discharge Summary:  In the meantime, patient has been discharged to home with a physician recommendation to continue with physical activities to recover and maintain functional capacity. Discharge from hospital:  Patient has been discharged, but is on the ventilator, so the hospital will be a while before discharge.

Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^%. Tonsils and salivary glands are affected but are not needed. Treatment of the Ulcer: This will be with cortisone cream, non toxic antiseptic, and with the following medications for the period of healing. Treatment of the Ulcer: This will be with cortisone cream, non toxic antiseptic, and with the following medications for the period of healing. Pain medications should never be used during the period of healing to try and shorten healing time for this condition. 
Plan of Treatment:  Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%.  Precautions:  Avoid alcohol while having an MRI. The following medications have been evaluated for treatment of tinnitus:  Dalmane, Cimetidine in patients with central or peripheral tinnitus who had moderate to severe tinnitus;   Cimetidine (Dalmane®/Metaprotere®) in patients with central or peripheral tinnitus who had moderate to severe tinnitus;  Clonidine (Sevidien®) in patients who have central or peripheral tinnitus who have moderate to severe tinnitus;  Ondansetron (Zofran®) in patients who have central or peripheral tinnitus with moderate to severe tinnitus. 
Plan of Treatment:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%Patient was also advised to limit physical exertion for one week until mass had decreased to normal. The patient was followed up during the three week period prior to surgery. Surgery  Surgery was performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital on February 5, 2006 using a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and he had only two days of follow-up after surgery. The procedure was performed under general anesthetic by an anesthesiologist and a neurosurgical resident. 
Plan of Treatment:  Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%Precaution: Do not use if the patient is allergic to aspirin. Patients suspected of having glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) may be treated with this product or an NSAID(such as indacaterol), which may be added to NSAIDs administered to patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Topical corticosteroid can be used to reduce the risk. Other: Follow instructions on the package pack carefully  Caring for Patients:  Ask the patient's doctor or nurse before using any products. 
Assessment & Plan:  The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks^%^%^%and there is no change. The patient is still unable to speak and will not be able to have food or water. It is difficult to know what stage the patient is at but there is no obvious improvement. The Patient is now scheduled for a CT Scan. Routine Tests:  Acetaminophen: This patient's symptoms cleared after the administration of acetaminophen at a dose of 200 mg twice daily. 
Assessment & Plan:  Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and ^%^%^%an electronic oxygen delivery device. The home oxygen and the delivery device will be monitored to make sure they are being used correctly throughout the hospital visit. We expect to receive an update in a couple days from him. While he was in the hospital, we had his family present. All of his questions and complaints were answered in our home visit. 
Assessment & Plan:  The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist^%^%^%/lung specialist for evaluation and treatment. The patient has normal respiratory function. The patient is a white male between the ages of 40 and 60 years with no smoking history, no history of emphysema, and no medical diagnoses of pulmonary disease or diabetes in the last 2 years. The patient has no past medical history of asthma or chronic bronchitis. 
Assessment & Plan:  Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection^%^%^% .     Exclusion:  - History of gastrointestinal (GI) problems  - Ureterocele with a size greater than 3.5 cm in any one direction  - Bladder surgery  - Cervical dystrophy  - Hypertension    - Medication use in the last 60 days  - Chronic liver disease  - Chronic kidney disease  - Chronic renal failure  - Pregnancy/lactation   - Drug and alcohol addiction  - Hypotension    - Urological or GI disease  - Pulmonary disease  - Chronic liver disease    - Metabolic illness/drug use  - Metabolic syndrome 
Assessment & Plan:  Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.^%^%^%If the fever does not go away, call your healthcare provider! If any of the symptoms worsen, please contact your healthcare provider. What to do next:  1. Make sure you get enough rest and fluids  2. If you are having any heart problems, check your echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization  3. If you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about how you are feeling now and how to prepare for delivery  4. 
Assessment & Plan:  Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension ^%^%^%is indicated. CPR is performed  at 1 day, with follow-up at 7 days and yearly thereafter. Lipid profile, physical examination, blood pressure, glucose level and creatinine level are noted. No change is seen in any parameters in the 12-18 year study period. Patient continues to have excellent renal function and is asymptomatic of the disease. Dose titration to a maximum of 3.0 mg/kg/day (30 mg daily at 3-day intervals) has been attempted. 
Assessment & Plan:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. ^%^%^%His electrocardiogram reveals right bundle-branch block which was consistent with a TIA. His pulse oximeter is elevated but at 90% of the baseline. His pulse rate is 50/min with a rhythm of 75/min with an R-waves. He was on no medication. Diagnostic Consideration:  This is a classic example of an acute ST-segment depression. If you would like to learn more about ST-segment depression, you can access this post at my blog or the  ST-Segmentation  study. 
Assessment & Plan:  Patient should follow up within 2 days and continue medications as prescribed^%^%^%.  Post Procedure: As with any surgery patients should follow up for pain, blood pressure, swelling, mood, and appearance at the end of the procedure. Results:  No significant side effects. 
Assessment & Plan:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%  
Assessment & Plan:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.^%^%^%This pregnancy was planned and she was evaluated with a c-section at 37 weeks. She did all prenatal tests and no fetal anomalies were suspected or detected. Her pregnancy was a bit more complicated and she had a small amniotic sac that developed early in labor (2 days ago). She underwent a laparotomy later the same day. I am going to make the judgment call that this was a result of her premature delivery, probably due to the amniotic sac or because of the placenta. 
Assessment & Plan:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction^%^%^%and stable coronary artery disease. Patient is on an intensive intensive therapy protocol and is being transferred from cardiac catheterization to surgical site after a 3 hour procedure. Initial presentation is mild hypertension (140/84), dyspnea (17/30), and chest pain (15/30) with acute-phase response. Her initial symptoms resolved without admission admission. She received intravenous phenobarbital and ticlopidine which were started at 2:00pm and continued till 11 pm. 
Assessment & Plan:  The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care^%^%^%physician. What if her child has severe peanut allergies - Is there any medicine to help calm them down? If a mother has a baby with severe peanut allergies, she should continue seeing a doctor who treats peanut allergies and is certified to treat these symptoms. To assist her better, ask the doctor for an allergy blood test and a referral to an allergy specialist. 
Assessment & Plan:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.^%^%^%All the tests described for the diagnosis are done within the first 24 hours of admission. All the tests show a significant degree of bilateral patellar dislocation and calcification of the synovial joint. The patient is transferred to orthopedic rehabilitation facility, where hip and patellar ligaments and their attachments are repaired, reattached to the femur, reconstructed, and the knee is immobilized again. 
Assessment & Plan:  Routine discharge to nursing home is scheduled for this afternoon. Patient should continue with physical and occupationsl therapy to regain strength^%^%^%& muscle mass. Discharge Summary:  Discharge of patient who was seen on Friday with severe chest pain and difficulty breathing. Discharge to home, accompanied by caretaker. Patient will need physical and occupational therapy to regain strength & muscle mass. (Agency response was: "All in favor.")  Date: March 10, 2017  Time: 11:30 a.m. Location: P&S Hospital  Client:        Summary of Report:  On Friday, 6/04/17, an adult male presented for chest pain. 
Assessment & Plan:  Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days^%^%^%; no evidence to advocate for continued medication at this time."  Summary: It appears to be a pretty standard report for what is a routine case for a very young girl with a history of multiple and/or acute episodes of tic and/or stuttering who, when taken to the doctor, did not receive the recommendation or the support, which, based on her prior histories of developmental issues, would have likely led to further diagnosis of autism based on the child's presentation. 
Assessment & Plan:  Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications^%^%^%. Patient was offered a 2nd MRI on the basis of the initial scan. Patient chose to decline both MRI's on the basis of her current health concerns. Results: The initial CT scan found a large lesion of cortical thickness in the left hemisphere ( Figure 2 ). A second CT scan was conducted in December of 2009 to provide a more complete evaluation of cortical thickness of the left hemisphere and an additional MRI completed in April 2010. 
Assessment & Plan:  The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^% . 
Assessment & Plan:  Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%. If no signs of heart attack or symptoms occur then do not stop taking medications and continue your care plan. Treatment for High Blood Pressure  Treatment for high blood pressure is not the same as it is for hypertension. If you have hypertension, the first step in treatment is to follow your doctor's treatment plan. If you do not have hypertension you will need to work with your doctor to determine which type of treatment is best for you. 
Assessment & Plan:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%Patient was scheduled for surgery. Treatment:  The patient was instructed to use a low doses of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications, and undergo a course of cortisone. At the 7-week follow-up interval the patient was instructed to stop and maintain at a non-smoking abstinence period. Outcome:  At the 7-week follow-up interval the patient had achieved full remission of the disease. 
Assessment & Plan:  Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%if no change in performance; if improvement in performance, follow-up in 2 months. Outcome:   Patient assessment:    Cognitive:   General medical:   Lung evaluation:    Physical exam:   Mental health care:   Pre-specified follow-up: 1-2 years  Outcome:   Patient assessment:    Cognitive:   General medical:   Lung evaluation:    Physical exam:   Mental health care:   Treatment:   Outcome:  Patient assessment:    Cognitive:   General medical:   Lung evaluation:    Physical exam:   Mental health care:   Outcome:   Patient assessment:    Patient and family assessment:   Overall physical performance, with and without neurological symptoms:  Pre-specified follow-up: 4 months. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks^%^%^%.  If the patient denies any involvement with any illicit drugs or alcohol, the following tests can be ordered: blood testing of the patient; urine testing of the patient; blood tests of the patient's blood and urine; blood work up of the patient; blood tests of the patient's blood and urine; blood work up of the patient's blood and urine; physical and laboratory examinations of the patient. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and ^%^%^%will be placed in home care. As a result of his hospitalization, Pt is experiencing depression and is currently seeking professional treatment. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist^%^%^%annually. Pulmonology Management:  The patient is on bronchodilator medication and is at risk for future episodes of pulmonary exacerbation. Management of Chronic Intracranial Haemorrhage  Intracranial haemorrhage is the most frequent and most serious complication of stroke. Intracranial haemorrhaging can occur when blood is drawn in an out-of-hospital setting to prevent or reduce bleeding. In a hospital or inpatient setting, clotting factors in the blood may protect against further blood loss. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection^%^%^%.  Outcome:  Patient returned home 7 days after admission and showed no recurrence of urethral discharge. Conclusion:  This is one of the worst case scenarios in which ED antibiotic use is appropriate. Most urethral complaints are of such a rare nature that this patient likely would not have been missed if ED antibiotic administration instead relied solely on patient history, examination, and other diagnostic resources. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.^%^%^%Urology:  This patient is currently taking antiserum to the following viral infections: EHF + RNF35; CXRXA + CCL2M; OVA+ RNF55; OVA2 + OVA16; EHF+ OVA; EHF + RNF18; EHF+ RNF33; T-cells + RNF17; & CXRLXA1. Recommended Drug(s) for this Disease / Health Condition: N/A  Recommended vaccinations are listed in this report. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension ^%^%^%Management History:      Treatment:  ? 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. ^%^%^%The history is consistent with a pre-existing atrial fibrillation. The patient should meet the diagnosis of PACE and undergo initial treatment including epinephrine. If the patient is unable to follow the initial treatment, the patient should receive continuous beta-blocker therapy for at least 8 h while the patient continues to follow the original treatment. Discussion:  The patient is a 48 y.o. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient should follow up within 2 days and continue medications as prescribed^%^%^%Case Resolution:  Patient has completed treatment as described in the protocol and no further symptoms associated with CFS have developed after the cessation of medications. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%After one week in the ICU, she developed a right lower quadrant low back pain that did not respond to rest; this was seen by the OR at 7 months. Her blood pressure was within normal limits. She received a 1 month postop antibiotic treatment with 1 g of gentamicin daily and this was successful in treating a 2 day history of pain with anorexia. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.^%^%^%She was given birth training the week before and the nurses who performed the Cesarean was experienced. She gave birth to an intact baby girl, born in an Emergency Cesarean and delivered safely and with a low risk of mother, newborn, and child complications. The obstetric staff member on shift that night took the mother outside her room to perform some simple vaginal labor, which was helpful. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction^%^%^%, with an admission cardiac index of less than 3. Diagnostic Criteria: T-wave, STEMI, Q-wave, P-wave, PR interval (all <3 sec), echogenic mitral regurgitation  Initiated Treatment & Outcome: Successful percutaneous coronary intervention  Initial Implantation:   7.6 cm  0 months after implantation, the Q wave was reduced to P-wave  2 months after implantation, there was good P-wave progression and a decrease in the Q wave  Outcome: Good  Outcome: No change  Parsons (2003-2008)  Background: This is an example of a patient with PCHI who died with myocardial infarction (MI) after myocardial revascularization  Patients: A 42 year old female with no prior history of myocardial disease; age 55 years  Primary end point: Recurrence of MI  Outcome: No recurrence of MI  Conclusion: The patient was followed up after MI recurrence, and a subsequent post-MI follow-up showed her without evidence of PCHI recurrence or death  Diagnostic Criteria: Q wave abnormalities >3 mm VQ  Disease State = Myocardial infarction with or without angiography  Initiated Treatment / Outcome:  No treatment  Secondary end point: Changes in Q waves during the first year of follow-up  Diagnostic Criteria: Progressive Q waves  Disease State = Angina Pectoris with or without a PQ-wave in 1/2 of the second half of the Q-wave  Initiated Treatment / Outcome: No treatment  Secondary end point:  No treatment  Cullberg (2010)  Background: Patients were treated with PCI; most were older (>60-79) women who had myocardial infarction with revascularization. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care^%^%^%. The patient was able to manage her allergies with these modalities. Discussion:  This is another case of subacute systemic lupus erythematosus. With the use of noninvasive skin blood test and other testing with a positive reaction, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis could have been ruled out. Top of Page  3. A 30–35-year-old woman was seen for a minor surgery after an episode of exacerbation of an abdominal pain. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.^%^%^%The following treatment options are available:   Routine Therapy:  Lumbar decompression and stabilization. (see Rt-R and Lumbar-Lumbar Spinal Rehab, p 11)  Transjugular intra-arterial injection of a corticosteroid. (see Spinal Rehab, 2nd ed., p 16)  Transjugular intra-arterial injection of a corticosteroid. (see Spinal Rehab, 2nd ed., p 16) Stabilization using physiotherapy techniques. (see Spinal Rehab, 2nd ed., p 17)   Anterior Knee Injury:  Routine therapy:  Lumbar decompression to increase bone mineral density. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Routine discharge to nursing home is scheduled for this afternoon. Patient should continue with physical and occupationsl therapy to regain strength^%^%^%and mobility. Discharge to other home or nursing home. Treatment:  Immediately discontinue all antiemetics, antiemetic titers. Administer fluid boluses on a frequent basis with the following schedule: 5 mL/kg as tolerated. Administer IV fluids as indicated. Monitor the patient for signs of dehydration. Monitor body temperature and electrolyte levels. For patients with signs of decreased cardiac output (decreased maximal heart rate <90 beats/min), provide oxygen as needed on a continuous basis. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days^%^%^%.  Management:  There are two types of therapy for depression: psychotherapy (SSRIs and TCAs) and antidepressant medications. If the patient is using psychotherapies, such as SSRIs or TCAs, these are likely to alleviate symptoms quickly. Medications are indicated because medications can slow down the brain and can take days to weeks to work. In that case, antidepressants may be required to reduce symptoms again. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications^%^%^% . 
Assessment & Recommendation:  The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^%.  Conclusion:  This patient had the most severe case of ulcer which required skin graft removal after 7-weeks of therapy with antibiotics. The ulcer is still healing and the physician is monitoring the patients progress. Pre- and Post-grafts:  The patient had a complete recovery and was no longer receiving corticosteroid therapy. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%.  Cardiologist is responsible for: EKG Monitoring. This may be done by telephone or in person (in the absence of the resident). Monitoring. This may be done by telephone or in person (in the absence of the resident).

Assessment & Recommendation:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%Procedure:    Hematology:  Blood was cultured at 25% (3-4x10(16) CD45) with BHIAA and FITC for 6 weeks followed by antigen withdrawal. Tests:  Cox2 assayed for IgM to cow's testicle and a B cell count of 9,000/µL. Serology:    Routine Blood Samples:  B cell count 6x10(16) CD45. Routine Biopsy:   Clinical Findings:   The patient had minimal swelling and no fever. 
Assessment & Recommendation:  Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%.  Vaccination:  To be done in the first year of life. Exposure:  Any contact of infant. Outcome:  There was no evidence of vaccine related autoimmune diseases after this vaccine. Conclusion:  I was worried about a reaction from this vaccine. I was told that there would be no reaction until my child was almost 2 years old. I did not read any reports of problems by this age. 
Assessment / Plan: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks^%^%^%(with the patient's permission). Dosing: The patient is given 3 units of 1:1 CBD:THC in 100mg capsule (with a total CBD dose, including pre-treatment, of 1.9mg). Expected Consequence: The patient's symptoms are decreased, with no psychoactive effects. Comments: This regimen provides an excellent relief from pain, and the patient does not feel high or hallucinated. 
Assessment / Plan: Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and ^%^%^%_______. [01:22:15]EMOTE: *no key*/(monkey (464)) : <b>The monkey (464)</b> waves her tail.

Assessment / Plan: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist^%^%^%and intercostal muscle testing at 4-6 months. The patient is a healthy woman and on the no adjuvant cyclophosphamide. The diagnosis of MS is made by a chest x-ray and an electrocardiogram. The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist and intercostal muscle testing at 4-6 months. The patient is a healthy woman and on the no adjuvant cyclophosphamide. 
Assessment / Plan: Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection^%^%^%Date of Enrollment: July 8, 2012  Appointments for this procedure: Monday – Friday, 7 a.m. – 8 p.m. Determine whether to treat a suspected low-severity acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with penicillin. Penicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat a variety of infections. The antibiotic daptomycin is used to treat urinary tract infections related to UTI and other types of bacterial infections. 
Assessment / Plan: Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.^%^%^%Urinary problems: Urinary frequency and clear urine are a sign of kidney and bladder function (in older people) or diabetes (in children). Swelling  Mild fever and chills: Mellowness tends to be an early sign of a flu infection in children, but can usually be treated by the immune system. If swollen lymph nodes or body sores are common, seek urgent medical assistance. 
Assessment / Plan: Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension ^%^%^%  1 (A1C>6%) and a low serum creatinine   0.50 mg/dL can lead to renal insufficiency and require dialysis. The patient's hemoglobin, electrolyte and creatinine levels were   7.5 (normal) 1.5 mg/dL and 6.0 mg/dL, respectively. In late January 2015, she developed a right renal papillary carcinoma and underwent radiation therapy. In June 2015, the patient underwent open liver resection   3 (LRP3). 
Assessment / Plan: Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. ^%^%^%She has normal electrocardiogram. Cardiologist:  "We've got a new cardiac rhythm. We're going to induce another rhythm. This is probably a pericardial effusion." (Pause) "Or worse." [Cardiologist to patient] "You didn't just pass out! This is a serious situation!"  [Cardiologist to patient] "If we don't make a fist and do chest compressions, it's a pericardial effusion or a ruptured aneurysm, you're going to die."  [Treatment of a patient with an aneurysm] "You're going to bleed profusely from your chest and lungs. 
Assessment / Plan: Patient should follow up within 2 days and continue medications as prescribed^%^%^%, up to and including the end of the third week after discharge. If symptoms persist or resolve, follow up with an infectious diseases specialist. Compliance / Compliance: Patient is required to notify family within 14 days of discharge. The patient must complete the following: a brief, electronic, informed consent form; annual physical and screening physical exam  Medical record review by an infectious diseases specialist at a hospital or health care provider with expertise in patient care, the clinical use of Ebola, and virus-specific precautions  Proforma discharge plan for the patient, including complete health information, including detailed questions about the patient's travels and contacts, all medical information, and any special precautions or restrictions The patient must complete and sign the following: Medical release forms  Personal statement for physician, referring physician, nursing team, healthcare administrator, and infectious diseases specialist  Copy of medical discharge form by the patient The patient must sign a consent form indicating that the patient has read, understood, and is voluntarily providing all information about the risks, risks, and benefits of being an Ebola patient to his or her provider, the hospital, and the U.S. 
Assessment / Plan: She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%She did have a second transient stroke in 2013 when she was having her third child. She received an MRI with a CT angiogram in early 2013 for a subdural cyst and is now back to normal. Presentation: Stroke of the inferior occipital white matter with a T12 lesion at a V3.0 to V5.5 location (Figure 1). No other neurological deficit. 
Assessment / Plan: The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.^%^%^%All signs were negative, she remained well on birth control pills and she had a normal pre-pregnancy weight, height and blood pressure. There was evidence of a history of a lower leg infection. The patient's obstetrician was a midwife and she had had a previous C-section with complications. Discussion / Conclusion: The midwife's assessment of the labor environment was correct as she noted no history of an adverse delivery. 
Assessment / Plan: 56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction^%^%^%on day 2 and has been previously prescribed valproate. On admission, was given daclizumab as monotherapy, with doses of 300 mg/day for 1 day followed by 300 mg/day divided into 3 doses daily for 13 days for treatment of early phase hypertension. During the initial 5-day observation period, it was noted that there were no significant safety concerns, that there were no obvious clinical findings that might be potentially suggestive of CNS toxicity, and there were no other significant side effect profiles that would significantly restrict the patient's ability to participate in future care. 
Assessment / Plan: The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care^%^%^%in a few weeks. Dieter: The patient had a normal intake of foods including dairy such as cheese and yogurt, eggs, fish, chicken and meat. Her diet was based on foods that are low in saturated fat with no added sugars or cholesterol. Her lifestyle including exercise (BMI 40-45) has not changed much over the last 1~yr, except when she went to a swim club for 3 years. 
Assessment / Plan: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.^%^%^%The patella appears to be calcified, so a thorough examination to assess for patellofemoral pain is not required. If a lateral rotation assessment is found, the hip is flexed and elevated (elevated for the patellar component which does not have calcified synovium and may be very soft, and for the flexed knee), the knee is flexed, then flex again, then flex once more, followed by internal rotation, then extensor flexion. 
Assessment / Plan: Routine discharge to nursing home is scheduled for this afternoon. Patient should continue with physical and occupationsl therapy to regain strength^%^%^%, and return to work. Patient's condition remains stable. Discharge Information: Patient scheduled for discharge at 4:30 p.m. Subject, in stable condition in nursing home. Date of Death: 5/20/2008. Age at Death: 82  Location of Death: Unknown  Cause of Death: Acute myocardial infarction  Primary Disclosures: Medical history as follows: Acute myocardial infarction 9/23/1988; Acute pancreatitis 7/18/1989; Acute pancreatitis 10/21/1989. 
Assessment / Plan: Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days^%^%^%if possible in order to assess her prognosis. Assessment is for the purposes of determining appropriate course of action. Recommended Regimen:   Oral Fluvoxamine 25mg/day  Alternative Regimen: Fluoxetine 10mg twice a day: 10 mg orally, followed by a 5-7 mg t-2 hour tablet in the morning and an additional 5-7 mg in the evening as directed. For patients on Fluoxetine, maintenance doses should be prescribed at the same rate as maintenance doses given when the 5-7 mg t-2 hour dose was given. 
Assessment / Plan: Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications^%^%^%.  Case Number: 17-02582  Date: 05/01/2013  Location: Dallas, TX, USA  Case Characteristics: The patient was a 36 yr old black female, who presented to the ED complaining of abdominal pain and nausea that was being relieved by gastric tube placement at the time of presentation. There were no underlying medical conditions known at the time of presentation (pulmonary emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure). 
Assessment / Plan: The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^%. He should be seen with the same primary care physician as before; he may be referred to a specialist for additional assessment or surgery. Management of the Ulcer  Treatment: Ulceration should be closed with topical antibiotics and wound closure with sutures. Wound dressings should be changed every 8–12 hours. Careful irrigation and rest of wound should be provided. Follow-Up:  Oral antibiotics, if needed may be given until healed. 
Assessment / Plan: Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%only. If possible, use with a physician on the same plan. Continue treatment as directed regardless of the above medications. For more information about a cardiac medications regimen for a heart transplant, see Transfusion Medicine. Cardiovascular Disease  Assessment / Plan: Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications only. If possible, use with a physician on the same plan. 
Assessment / Plan: After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%No treatment was given beyond that. 
Assessment / Plan: Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%.  Dental Intervention: Follow-up until permanent dentures are in place. Periodic Oral Health Follow-up visits: 2 (4 months to 3 years). Probiodic Screening: Periodic testing for plaque with a staining test, oral rinse exam, biopsies, and tooth sensitivity. Management Options / Safety Considerations: For patients with dental caries, management includes:  Regular evaluation of caries and tooth loss. Caries may occur with the development of other oral conditions with no history of oral disease, such as periodontal disease, periodontal infection, systemic candidiasis, and tooth decay secondary to dental procedures (eg, root canal treatment and periodontal decompression). 
Assessment: The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks^%^%^%. It is his next course of treatment. He returns as normal at six weeks' follow-up but develops a fever in two weeks and is again a nonpersonality, noncompliance. He returns for three-day visits and during the third, he has a spontaneous bowel movement. The first is unremarkable. There is not an obvious cause for the bowel movement. The second visit, two weeks later, is the classic "rediscovery" of the colonic polyp and it is excised and placed in a bag. 
Assessment: Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and ^%^%^%erythromycin. He will be moved to a residential care unit once he has been monitored for 3 more days. He has not returned to active treatment work as the results of the blood test are still pending. The following are some examples of what some people may have experienced as a result of an "overdose". Blood test results were not available until many days after the poisoning. 
Assessment: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist^%^%^%.  Explanation: The clinician would expect a high threshold at which a pulmonary study by computed tomography should be performed and not need to wait for clinical progression. Discussion: An assessment of time for the onset of progression may be helpful in setting the threshold for initiating pulmonary function testing and thus may help in guiding diagnostic and treatment decisions. Conclusion: An initial assessment should consider clinical, radiologic, and diagnostic criteria, as well as the time course and frequency of progression. 
Assessment: Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection^%^%^%that arose from a history of severe trauma to genitalia at birth. 
Assessment: Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.^%^%^%Treatment:  If you are diagnosed with fever after a prolonged period, and/or with only urinary symptoms, then a hospital admission may be required. This procedure will not improve the prognosis and will usually result in hospital discharge in 3-5 days. If you feel you have been exposed to a pathogen, the first place to seek support is with your GP, who will have a better information to share with the medical team. 
Assessment: Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension ^%^%^%(systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg) are required to achieve therapeutic targets; this patient is an example of the "healthy" patient from which we can learn from. A patient with "high risk" renal failure without hypertension and with chronic kidney disease is less clearly defined. A patient who has a positive family history of CVD with a family history of renal failure is also in that class. 
Assessment: Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. ^%^%^%Cognitive impairment is minimal. 
Assessment: Patient should follow up within 2 days and continue medications as prescribed^%^%^%.  Treatment: If the rash is very severe and is not improving, then the medical community recommend to discontinue all treatment and contact your health care provider who will administer the next best treatment. If the rash reappears for more than 3 days, then patients should also contact their health care provider who will determine if further testing is warranted and recommend the next best treatment. 
Assessment: She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%There were no other findings that would merit further investigation beyond what occurred at ED. Date of Birth: 8/29/89  Age: 30  Height: 160-180 cm  Weight: 49 kg  Blood Type: O  Fractures: None  Previous Occupation: Home Healthcare  Tourette Syndrome  Risk Factors:  The patient was a home care user and had a history of mental health issues. Family history of T-scores within the normal range: None. 
Assessment: The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.^%^%^%The husband was on bed rest through day 3 with no recurrences of labor. The only major medical problem was a pregnancy complication. Case 2: The patient showed up with a fever and her fetus was at 38 weeks' gestational age. A prenatal CT scan showed a 13.5 centimeter long lesion on the uterine wall in the position of the fetus's sacrum. 
Assessment: 56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction^%^%^%. He is a patient with an initial coronary syndrome. Study: 1) The primary endpoint was the number of patients who experienced a serious adverse cardiac event. 2) The secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were alive 1 month after hospital discharge without a major cardiovascular event. Study: In addition to the 7+3 induction, the cardiac catheterization technique was used. 
Assessment: The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care^%^%^%.  Radiology: No imaging indicated any tumor findings. Radiographs showed no signs of focal soft tissue calcifications. At this time, the radiologist stated that they have no additional clinical or imaging findings of interest, and no treatment options were considered. Endocrine: This patient was treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Her initial T 4 was 7.14 pmol/L and her TI at 8.3 pmol/L. 
Assessment: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.^%^%^%The patient is also found to have right pectineus muscle weakness, medial tibial nerve compression with anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with right side weakness and the presence of biceps tendonitis in the biceps femoris (p-1 and p-2). The patient presents with an ankle pain, lateral swelling and fever. Management: The patient is given prophylactic anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) type I, II and IV and an anti-inflammatory and anti-diarrheal treatment. 
Assessment: Routine discharge to nursing home is scheduled for this afternoon. Patient should continue with physical and occupationsl therapy to regain strength^%^%^%and muscle control. Report: Patient remains in a ventilator awaiting discharge. Clinical Course: Respiratory infection, pneumonia, and abdominal pain have all occurred. Physical deterioration and increased muscle temperature have been noted with the exacerbation of the pneumonia. The patient is now losing bone mass and muscle mass. 6-22-06  Nurse #2-Pneumonia Patient  Recovery: Received a "counseling" at 9:45 AM; discharged home shortly thereafter. 
Assessment: Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days^%^%^%for any worsening of her symptoms. (A) Dental X-Rays  Possible: No change;  Signs: The patient's exam findings on dental X-rays demonstrated complete resorption of the teeth, with slight bony displacement and small areas of enamel loss. Clinical Relevance: A severe form of bone loss can develop following a carotid artery dissection. Clinical Context: The condition is most apparent following a carotid artery dissection, or CAD. 
Assessment: Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications^%^%^%, including anti-hypertensive therapies. Discussion: This patient was evaluated by the neurologist at a neurology practice based in a community hospital. The following is a brief description of the presentation: The patient presented to the clinic with moderate to severe bilateral upper extremity weakness. At the time of exam he had a history of recent surgery with bilateral hip arthroplasty. 
Assessment: The ulcer will continue to heal on its own with proper care and dressing change. Pt was advised of proper nutritions and to watch for fever or redness for potential infection^%^%^%. Pt was advised of treatment if symptoms persisted. CONCLUSION: In this report, we describe a patient with an open perianal abscess who did not develop an abscess when the abscess was drained. We suggest that this patient may have had a local infection with the abscess as the origin of the abscess. The authors did not have any conflicts of interest. 
Assessment: Refer to cardiologist for additional monitoring. Continue on current medications^%^%^%. Patients with suspected acute kidney injury should be managed conservatively and monitored until renal function returns to normal by performing a 24-hour urine collection and/or re-weighed urine. Cigarette Smoking: Patients smoking a minimum of 10 tobacco cigarettes per day, or less than once daily, should not be prescribed naltrexone. 
Assessment: After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%__________________________ _________________  Tumors in Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis or Eosinitis Ocularis  Tumors in these patients are often asymptomatic. Patients need careful clinical judgment as they proceed with biopsy to exclude tumors. If these patients are being treated, careful monitoring of tumor size and appearance is desirable. Patients with this condition need additional follow-up visits to evaluate progression or recurrence. 
Assessment: Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%)  Clinical remission was seen in all participants. No patients were required to restart the medication or lose weight, which was a positive development for the study and is a step towards finding a treatment for weight-related diseases as well as preventing their occurrence in the first place. The trial was also encouraging. Although patients lost 5% of the initial weight during the trial, their average BMI did not return to the pre-treatment level in any of the groups. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): The patient is scheduled for follow-up with his PCP in two weeks^%^%^%(two months on or off the meds) at his or her convenience. You would contact your patient when available but it can be best to have him or her call for an early appointment, since then the doctor can be present to discuss any concerns about the medication.  In the meantime, the patient is asked to keep a diary of all symptoms, side effects, physical exam, ECG results, and any other information that may affect the doctor's decision.  At this point the next step is to provide a written history of all medications you have taken (including vitamins) for months since the start of therapy. To do so, the doctor checks the patient's pharmacy records for each medication (you should have copies of them by date), and provides any additional information needed to document the history.  An individualized treatment plan is provided:  Medication history—the doctor will review the records to make sure that at the appropriate stage of the illness, you were well-prepared.  Patient goals—the doctor must evaluate your physical, emotional, and psychological state in the context of the medications to guide therapeutic decisions. For example, some of the common goals for patients may include "I am getting better," "I am happy," and "I am able to function at work." 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Pt will be discharged from the hospital today with a supply of home oxygen and ^%^%^%erythromycin. As we discussed earlier, there are two different forms of this condition – "primary", in which the symptoms start before birth, and "secondary", where they begin after birth. In many cases, the "primary" syndrome ends in a baby being born dead. But in other cases, this "second stage" of MDM may not be so obvious, and in this case there may be hope for a healthy baby. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and requires follow-up with a pulmonologist^%^%^%. There has never been a time in history when a treatment plan for severe asthma was developed by this type of care group and the MDM group with complete accuracy. It was not always the case that a pulmonologist was available for followup with a person with this disease. In the past, lung function tests, a bronchoscopy, and CT or MRI were not routinely performed for adults with asthma. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Patient will be discharged to home from ED with a 7-day course of antiobotics to treat an acute urinary tract infection^%^%^%. Emergency department management is recommended for acute urinary tract infection and acute bladder pain (Table). Infectious Diseases:  Pneumonia: Follows the infection with observation of changes in respiratory sounds (tachycardic and diaphoretic). Emergency physician recommends treatment for acute respiratory tract infection with 2 antibiotics: ceftriaxone and azithromycin. E. coli: Follows the infection with observation of fever and signs of dyspnea and abdominal pain. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Fever and urinary symptoms: Should these symptoms return please contact your family doctor urgently or visit your nearest emergency department.^%^%^%If symptoms start to worsen, call 999 immediately. (The following information has been extracted from the National Health Service (NHS) guidance) The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE):  "Amphetamines are contraindicated in a child on the ventilator or who has a respiratory or cardiac condition. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) should not be used in children and should not be administered with amphetamines in elderly patients as studies have shown that the metabolism of these drugs affects the body's tolerance. The risk of potentially fatal blood thinning in the elderly is more likely to occur if acetaminophen is used in combination with a stimulant medicine. The risk of blood thinning is most likely to occur when a drug is used as a standalone medicine or taken together with an oral anticoagulant used for angina pectoris, although it may also occur in patients treated with long-term methotrexate (sold under the brand name Diltiazem) or at some risk of bleeding. In some situations, it is beneficial to increase the dose of the first drug given. If the patient has symptoms of the common cold or is experiencing sneezing (also known as watery mucous), then the child is probably allergic to the drug. If the symptoms continue, it may be appropriate to increase the dose of the drug, take it more frequently when you are awake, change the child's medicine, or remove the medication from the child's medicine table." 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Pt is a uncontrolled type 2 diabetic with stage 3 chronic kidney disease. A nephrology consult and continued management of hypertension ^%^%^%0.3 mmol/L is performed. Follow-up is not required beyond 7 calendar days. The nephrologist will recommend appropriate drugs to manage the risk of recurrent episodes and provide a management plan. After a period of observation in the home and on an outpatient basis, the patient will be referred to a cardiologist for a detailed review of all the pre- and post-admission history, physical examination, treatment plan, follow-up management and outcomes. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Patient is a 48 y.o. who presents after fainting earlier in the day with an irregularly irregular rhythm on ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation. ^%^%^%She reports being sedated for most of the day. [3]   During the initial evaluation after fainting, it became clear that the patient was not experiencing a heart attack but rather a fainting episode due to atrial fibrillation. [4] MDM is a process in which the clinician must evaluate the appropriateness of medication given to the patient, and determine whether the patient is safe to continue with that medication. 
Medical Decision Making (MDM): Patient should follow up within 2 days and continue medications as prescribed^%^%^%Opiates and Benzodiazepines: Patient may only see the doctor/practitioner who prescribed them unless the patient is unable to reach someone, in which case the doctor may decide to prescribe inpatient rehab.

Comments: If a wound is large, or the infected area is larger than 1 cm in width, conservative treatment may not be adequate and treatment with antibiotics and anti-fungal meds may be required. Dry Skin  Drug Interactions  Cannabis Interaction: Cannabinoid agonists may interfere with the anti-inflammatory actions of marijuana. Marijuana smoking also reduces the effects of NSAID drugs such as ibuprofen. 
Plan of Treatment:  She suffered a mild transient ischemia attack although was discharged from the ED with family to home.^%^%^%Her stroke required 2 weeks in follow up hospital after which she experienced headache which resolved with aspirin and acetaminophen. Conclusion:  The current case report of patient with acute ischemic stroke, who was treated with a single dose of aspirin, supports the use of aspirin as an adjunct pharmacologic approach for stroke. This would be more likely to benefit patients with acute ischemic stroke, who have normal neurologic results. 
Plan of Treatment:  The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery.Plan of Treatment:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction^%^%^%. The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. Her spouse was reactive and reassuring throughout the course of her stay in labor and delivery. Plan of Treatment:  56 year old patient with history of AML without CNS involvement who is status post successful 7+3 induction therapy being admitted for acute myocardial infarction. The patient was admitted in spontaneous labor in the morning of Jan 3rd. 
Plan of Treatment:  The patient was seen for a well visit with no major complaints. For seasonal allergies, continue on OTC medications and schedule her next visit with primary care^%^%^%staff during the peak season (April through November). This patient did not have any significant complications with her medications. The following medications were stopped: (1) Clarithromycin; (2) AlliPen (a.u. in children with moderate to severe wheezing and/or difficulty in breathing); (3) Salbutamol; (4) Amoxil; (5) Lidocaine for milder cough; for moderate to severe wheezing; (6) Tylenol; (7) Percocet, Dilaudid, codeine and codeine and aspirin. 
Plan of Treatment:  The patient is admitted for further evaluation and is found to have bilateral anterior compartment syndrome and right hip abduction dysfunction with bilateral patella dislocation with degenerative changes and calcified synovitis.^%^%^%Diagnosis of both conditions is made by an evaluation of right joint structure and synovitis. A right Knee Replacement can be performed, but its short lifetime with the current techniques leads to its exclusion, which prevents a patient from recovering to their pre-injury level. Prognosis for both conditions is poor - a few weeks should be expected after repair. Prevention of hip implant failure: the best way to avoid a patient suffering hip implant failure is to educate them to the risks and advantages of replacement. 
Plan of Treatment:  Routine discharge to nursing home is scheduled for this afternoon. Patient should continue with physical and occupationsl therapy to regain strength^%^%^%and range of motion. Patient's weight should be restored to normal by the time his doctor is available in two weeks. Case Report 2: A 69 year old man who had previously been diagnosed as a severe diabetic and who was found to be non diabetic had several recent seizures. He is now in full remission with a normal glucose level. 
Plan of Treatment:  Patient will continue medications and therapy at home. Follow-up with her PCP is recommended within the next 7 days^%^%^%.  Prognosis: In a general population of adults with MS, survival rate is greater than 80% when compared to MS patients with the same severity, stage, and diagnosis. Clinical Relevance: This study supports the role of the CD4 T-cell response in MS. This is demonstrated to be higher in the patients with MS compared to MS patients with the same disease activity, stage, and diagnosis; this finding provides a new avenue for clinical development of CD4-targeted therapies for MS. 
Plan of Treatment:  Patient was advised of surigical options but currently plans to pursue continued therapy and medications^%^%^%without resorting to surgical intervention:  The primary goal is to maximize patient compliance by addressing underlying underlying medical concerns and providing education regarding safe and effective methods of treatment. Surgical treatment -  The primary goal of surgery is to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Postoperative care -  The patient will be expected to remain in the hospital until the end of the 6 week period following surgery or until medically necessary surgery is performed.

Plan of Treatment:  After biopsy, the mass was determined to be benign. Patient was advised to watch for additional growth or change. ^%^%^%If any progression was observed, he was prescribed a high-dose, anti-estrogenic medication to prevent ovulation. If no growth or change had been noted after two months of treatment, he was started on the prescribed estradiol and progesterone meds, at a time when he menstruated and began taking a daily oral contraceptive. At the end of the first year of follow up, the patient had not menstruated at all. 
Plan of Treatment:  Follow-up in 3 months^%^%^%Interim Phase:  A single-blind crossover study lasting 30 days in the active group. Follow-up in 3 years in the drug group  Long-term Phase:  Follow-up after 3-years in the drug group and 12 years after randomization in the active drug group  Data to support the Phase 4 Dose Escalation:  In the active drug group, 2 uncontrolled studies found no significant difference between study arms for safety or effectiveness at the time of discontinuation, whereas 2 uncontrolled studies found significant differences between study arms.
